Polarity,Review Text
0,It stinks!: Months of airing out can not take away the hideous stench coming out of these mats. Avoid at all costs.
0,"Disappointed: This was my first Danielle Steel novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed by it. The plot was interesting enough that I stuck with it to the end, but the book was in serious need of a good editor. The author repeated herself repeatedly. I felt as though I were reading a first draft instead of a finished product. If you enjoy reading for the character development and beauty of the language as much as the plot, I do not recommend this book."
0,"I bought this blender. After a few months of use, it just stopped working. Still under warrantee, I mailed it to the company. 2 months later they mailed me a new blender. Two months after the warrantee expired it stopped working again. I am disappointed "
0,Not a blender for frozen fruit: Bought this blender a year ago to make smoothies using frozen fruit. I thought it worked great. Now the blades won't turn and the bottom rusting of all things.
0,"So Disappointing! Hurts your ears: I received it as a gift the next Xmas. The blender does an okay job blending and it has a glass jar. That is about it for the positives. It is the loudest kitchen appliance I have ever heard. My ears ring after using it and sometimes it hurts my ears. The rotation of the blades causes the blender jar to untwist from the base. Guess how much fun that is to clean up. So, not only is it so loud you want to be in another room when it is running, you must stand there and hold the jar still or you will have a true mess on your hands. Do not purchase this blender! This is the first time I have been disappointed. "

0,"Lasted a few minutes!: I wanted to buy the Thermoworks (new and improved) thermometer, but amazon offered it through an outside vendor which charged a shipping fee... and this one seemed to have gotten okay reviews, so i went with the cheaper option. i received it this past week and used it last night on our steaks. it started off okay. i was able to set the correct temperature on the display and saw that the temperature reading was going down once the probe went from the counter to the meat. when i looked over about 5 minutes later, the display was blank. i tried the power button but to no avail. i then thought it may be the battery, but even with a fresh one, the power wouldn't turn back on!so unless you need a disposable thermometer that lasts only for a few minutes, move onto another brand!"
0,"No Drama: I hate to give this book such a low rating but it was incredibly dull. The title might lead you to believe the author will paint a tale of two persons and compare the sides, but in fact she tells you in the first few pages that she sees him as a visionary. There is nothing in the book that would suggest the subject was a villain at all. I have a great interest and I could not finish this book - and this was my second attempt."
0,"very very disappointing: The picture & audio quality is very poor worse than a video tape ,maybe a bootleg copy."
0,Too small!: Was looking to put these on my car and they are just too small. I should have read the size closer before ordering.
0,"Not AT All What You'll Expect!: One of the controlling units didn't work. But, I waited too long to send it back. I didn't notice any ""Turbo"" enhancements at all when I played. If you're use to the original controllers, the control coordination will seem awkward on these. Overall, not satisfied."
0,"waste of money. I just bought this game about 20 minutes ago. I played it for 5 minutes and wanted to throw it away. The graphics are weak, game play is choppy and it is an all around boring game. I really wished I rented it first. I am going to trade this one away a.s.a.p."

0,"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY!!!: I purchased this product and went directly to installing it. The product did not work and when I tried to contact the seller he not only was not helpful, but he has not aided me in the return of the product. This is a perfect example of a poorly run company and my advice to any future buyers is to look somewhere else!! They are selling low quality parts and their customer service is inexistent. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING FROM THEM!!"
0,"A very poorly researched book: Having read through a couple dozen reviews on this book I have to add one more because I so totally disagree with what has been written in them and am shocked that so few people realized that the ending of ""Three"" was so completely implausible. If you know something about what is revealed, well then you will regret having wasted your time reading the book. My advice to the author that he needs to do better research or stick to what he knows. This book is a disservice to the public because it creates a false impression for the reader with regards to the issue that he brings up."
0,Poor quality: The sponge smells like some sort of chemical was used on it. The hand massage tool is indented. The bath salt smells just as bad as the sponge. I am honestly thinking about just throwing away a majority of this product and buying everything locally. Every single item in the basket is manufactured in China and I honestly could have found better items elsewhere.

0,NO FRAGRANCE:I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED TO FIND The PRODUCT HAD NO FRAGRANCE. IT ONLY HAS BODY WASH AND LOTION AND A BUNCH OF USELESS ITEMS. THERE IS NO BODY SPRAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE FOR THE PRICE.
0,a big let down from the first: I am a huge fan of the first video. This one however was a big letdown. Neither of my daughters will pay attention to it. Over all I just wouldn't recommend this at all.
0,IT WORRIES ME WHEN SELLERS DON'T PUT MEASUREMENTS: I don't trust sellers that don't add measurements and reliable information. They are always hiding something.
0,Product not as described: I really liked this nice set of glasses.    I ordered 1 set and got only 1 single glass. I wrote to seller many times and got no response back. I am still hoping to get remaining 11 glasses. I noticed I am not the only one with the same problem. Now I am stuck with 1 single glass that is overpriced. I am not happy about that.
0,"Too shallow: The book provides only shallow explanation of how TDD is supposed to work. Oversimplification may lead to bad code. The grammar does not have to be complete, but the framework has to be there from the beginning. the book begins to look like a commercial."
0,"Disappointing, & too long.: Bought this video thinking it was one that I had saw years ago, was wrong, this movie had quite a bit of excitement in it in the beginning but not so then . Glad for fast forward.... Would not recommend it. IMHO.. Unrealistic ending."
0,Poor Quality Rack: My wife and I received this as a wedding gift.The rack look nice and the spices seem to be of decent quality but the quality of the spice rack leaves much to be desired. The containers seem to be made of glass or a thick acrylic but the lids are made of cheap looking and plastic. They also do not close well.The rack itself is also made of cheap plastic and the spice containers fall off the racks occasionally.If I would have bought this I would return it. 
0,Disappointed: I was never so disappointed in a product as I was in this. It didn't do anything for m husband and I had such high hopes!
0,"Waste of Time: If you do not have infinite patience DO NOT buy this book. While it contains over 800 pages of nutritional information and is very comprehensive it is not organized. There is a very brief table of contents and no index at all. The contents are arranged alphebetically but there is no color coding or shading on the edges of the pages to indicate where A stops and B begins and so on. I HATED using it and only did so for about a week. Then I went out and bought a new calorie counting book which also included fat and carb information, which is all I need and wanted. My new book contains a Table of Contents, an index and is color coded and cost about 1/2 the price of  the previous one ."
0,The most complete food counter: I had to return this book back to amazon as I was not able to read the charts in the book 
0,"Disinformation abounds...: Any book on alternative medicine would be much better served were it not written by a medical doctor adhering to the outmoded egotistical attitude characteristic of many practitioners of Western medicine. Anyone who has actually researched the topics in which he professes to be an expert would know that chiropractic care is one of the safest alternatives to ""conventional"" treatment with drugs and surgery for many health problems.. Dr. X would do far better to base his work on actual research instead of the misinformation still and anyone interested in the topics he includes should look elsewhere for their facts."
0,"Two Tedious Hours: The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. "
0,"One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions. My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it."
0,"Batteries died within a year: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power."
0,"works fine, but Maha Energy is better: Check out Maha Energy's website. Their charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries."
0,Worst of the series!: Simply put this is the worst Halloween ever. I gave it two stars because over the years it became slightly better. Halloween 3 is better.
0,"DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but the DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony"
0,"Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it."
0,"DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
0,"A Waste of Film: This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen (worse than the horse whisperer). It's too dark, too much despair, and you just know if it was real the girl would've committed suicide shortly after."
0,"Not an ""ultimate guide"": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you."
0,"Pretty Weak!: I have bi-polar disorder, and I will say that this is only a fair history of manic depression. For that alone I give it two stars. The actors in this half hour documentary seem to overdo the disorder. It would be funny were it not so tragic."
0,"I found this book to be very disappointing. I loved the movie better than the book. The romance was not very well developed and well told. I mean, what is this feeling that they have that keeps forcing them together all the time? It certainly didn't sound like love. You just don't look at a person and say that you love him or her, you have to build a solid friendship with them first and then a relationship. Marrying the villain was not what I had in mind for the hero and the ending was quite well written however disappointing the whole story was. I don't recommend that you read this "
0,"Trendy and lame: This album is with no substance to back it up. The songwriting and production are weak and predictable, with no sense ."
0,"Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all throughout the book"
0,Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and haven’t worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
0,"If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (, and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash."
0,"Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done."
0,"works great: i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed, but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this. "
0,"Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
0,"Double charged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again."
0,"Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund."
0,Amazing...: love it....it's too bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
0,"A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing.I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame."
0,"Great Beginning...poor ending: Parricia Corwell, Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning! Her relation to her family, her dedication to her work exceptional. However, this story began to get boring towards the end...the ending, not too great."
0,"Wonderful, baffling mix: This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out."
0,"Disappointment at it's extreme: I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this. Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author."
0,"great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie, where is it?: the publisher said soon to be a movie. does anyone know if a movie was ever created?"
0,"Predictable & has a lame ending: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel."
0,A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes. Kudos to whoever owns the copyright .
0,"Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure, back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. "
0,Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance.
0,Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. 
0,nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately purchased the wrong size. She made a comment about dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it but the apparel was way too small. She was really excited to receive the apparel and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
0,"Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. The cover price will still leave you feeling ripped-off."
0,"I have read many of Jack Higgins' books and this is the poorest so far, in my humble belief. As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story."
0,Where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long . Very bored through the very wordy prologue. Then tried to find them. 
0,"Avoid it.: The abridged version of this book would read as so:""Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery.. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it."
0,ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that this  book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
0,"This edition is not complete: this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, ""The Custom-House."" Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition."
0,Creepy: The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again.
0,"waste of money. I just bought this game about 20 minutes ago. I played it for 5 minutes and wanted to throw it away. The graphics are weak, game play is choppy and it is an all around boring game. I really wished I rented it first. I am going to trade this one away a.s.a.p."
0,"Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"

0,Horrible reader: i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
0,"The ""Scarlet"" Letter: Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear."
0,"Although this book, is considered a great work of literature. it is boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book. This is a good book to study, however it is not a good book to read for pleasure, under any circumstance!!"
0,"This book is Great!: One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammar and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked this book.I think this this book will be wonderful, if you are willing to put effort into understanding it."
0,I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people told me what they think it is but I don’t agree and they don’t agree with each other.
0,"Possibly the funniest movie ever made. It starts off a bit slow, but once the product placement jokes start it takes off."
0,"Sassy Baby Warming Dish. We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small, and didn't really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant, although I think a blanket would work just as well."
0,Unreadable!: the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate.
0,"Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment."
0,one of the worst movies: god!!! what a dumb movie. tnicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide before watching it.
0,"very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all."
0,"8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. "
0,"Not the worst, but far from good: This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book ""The 50 worst films of all time"". It is definitely not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. "
0,"Been waiting for a foreign lauguage?: I have  one but the  translation is very choppy, the singers are mediocre at best, and the orchestrations are too overwhelming..Oddly, the best song is the French  one all great. "
0,"It Rises above the ""Fluff"" Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as said in an earlier. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on ""emotional states"" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book.The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic."
0,"I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition, rather than very good. I would like to thank the person who made it possible, but have misplaced his name and address."
0,I wish...: ...i had never heard from some people  before hearing this music but can’t help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explores it further...
0,"Good follow-up to .A bit of a change this time for Dredg, less progressive material, more straight ahead rock tunes. I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn't have alot of stuff going on which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms. But still this is the direction they chose to go in and it's definitely a very good one."
0,"This book really bothers me. If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability, do not read this book. It does not offer any advice for parents, just helps fuel negativity. If you are still in the grieving stage, this book will not help you. As parents, please try surrounding yourself with positives. Children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life. They can help you learn, help you become more empathetic, help you become stronger, and bring wonderful caring people into your life. Please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life. Do not waste your time listening to families stories of frustration, anger, sadness, and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives."
0,One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!! It's pity that they are almost retiring soon...
0,"Low class effort by this Band: the music is bland and poppy, the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten."
0,"Good Quality Cell Phone Holder: Contrary to other review, I found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever."
0,Loved it!: I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
0,Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!: I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!
0,"There is no way anyone with a soul could give this a negative review....: This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. They thought it was too intelligent for kids. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it."
0,"those R movie loving critics! ""They don't know entertainment"" as Krusty would say: I do love ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"", a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though."
1,Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
1,"This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season."
1,great Christmas gift: This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
1,Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
1,"The Best Present Of All: My children are a little old (age-wise) for this, but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year. This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come. Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special. I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday. Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic. This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus' delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children. This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection."
1,"Pretty Good...: Halloween 5 is another good sequel in the series. It is better than Halloween 4, because it isn't as boring. And it is much better than Halloween 6. It still doesn't add up to the original, but is one of the best sequels in the series. There are some good scary scenes and some great death scenes. It follows the storyline with Danielle Harris' character and her evil uncle...Pretty good, pretty good."
1,wow what a great come back of micheal meyers. I love the fact that i was able to purchase my halloween collection at such a great price at Amozon.com.
1,"Not the best although much more enjoyable than HALLOWEEN 2. This installment lacked the action of part 4, but it was still good. Michaels mask in this looked a bit pathetic and the way he killed people in this is like the style of Jason from FRIDAY THE 13TH movies. I liked the bit where he takes his mask off and sheds a tear, in a moment of thought. The ending is mysterious and there is also the appearance of a man dressed head to toe in black. Overall a good film which is better than part 2 & 6."
1,"realistic account: welcome to the dollhouse is a touching and realistic account of what its like to be on the outskirts of growing up. Dawn is a young girl trying to fight her way in. she deals with bullies, her parent’s rejection, and her own self hate. The film has its funny moments such as dawn standing over her sleeping sister's bed with a hammer in her hands. The character of dawn is well played but barely develops. Dawn’s family is very unlikeable strictly because of their arrogance and complete disregard of dawn. Overall the film is good. You will find yourself not only sympathizing with dawn but may find her angst and vulnerability a little like your own in the often harsh world of growing up. The ending could be better; it leaves you wondering about a lot of things. But despite the ending the film is heartfelt and very satisfying."
1,"I love this movie: This movie is one of the greatest ever made. From the title on down, it is virtually flawless. If you can't identify with the main character, then you are, one of the plastic people this movie is meant to rip. Hope you enjoy your empty life."
1,LOVE IT!: So sad this show is now over. Love the actors and storyline. Tara's different personalities are comical and you will relate to at least one of them.
1,I liked this one so much...: I liked this story so much that I actually enjoyed the TV movie of it too!! That says a lot. Super story!
1,"Only parts of it are good, but most of it is boring: The story revolves around the strikingly gorgeous Crystal, who is an aspiring actress. She goes through a lot of tragedies and grief, but remains determined to make her dream come true no matter what.Some of the book is good, like when Crystal first moves to San Francisco. Most of the book was boring though, like the relationship between Crystal and Spencer. There was always something keeping them apart, even after they kept finding each other, and it started to get old after a while. It took me a long time to read this, because I would get sick of it so easily, but I eventually finished it. In the end I still like Danielle Steel, but this one isn't a favorite."
1,"Wow, I'm glad I bought these: I can't say enough good things about these floor mats. They are better quality than I have found at my local discount stores. The mats are thicker, have better nubs on the bottom, better quality carpet, and they're larger and heavier.\"
1,"Cheap, yet Good: I bought this item about a month ago. The criteria was price. Cons about the rear mat is that it was much samller than what I expected."
1,"Nice Mats! No Smell!: These are nice heavy duty mats. They fit my 2001 Corolla perfectly! I found some similar ones at Walmart for a few dollars less but liked the look of these better. I was concerned about the ""chemical smell"" that some people had talked about but other than a slight smell from the rubber ( that dissipated quickly), there was no smell."
1,"Excellent quality!: I replaced the serpentine belt in my, easy to install and drove great afterwards! Excellent price!"
1,This therometer is just what I needed.. It seems to work good now after using it for a few months.
1,Would have been perfect ...: if the battery saving feature was optional. Difficult to just glance at current temp while in use .
1,"Great CD: I've taught Pre-K for 3 years and my kids LOVE this CD. It is definitely their favorite. Normally I buy a CD, copy the songs I like and then re-sell it. I love the whole thing. "
1,"Really pretty, I wear them often!: These arrived faster than I expected. They are a nice shape and thickness, and were not uncomfortably heavy, something I worry about when buying earrings online.The closure has a nice, solid 'click', and I'm always sure they're secure."
1,The Greatest Symphonic Poem: This is a wonderful recording of Sheherezade. The violin solos and the orchestration are rich and superb. The music itself is the greatest Symphonic Poem ever written. The listener is captured by the romantic and sensual atmosphere of the 1001 Nights in the adagios and will be taken to adventures in distant lands with Sinbad. The sea storm in this rendition would make Nikolai proud. 
1,"My kids like it. It's got excellent layout, clear pics, but isn't comprehensive. Great to look through, I had that one when I was a kid. I am glad I bought it - it makes a pleasant."
1,Not compatible...: DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT IF NEVER USED BEFORE. NEED BETTER INSTRUCTION MANUAL. DO NOT KNOW HOW TO OPERATE! SOFTWARE IS CHEESY AND NOT COMPATABLESOMETIMIE...
1,"great egg spectations: As always, I was very amused by watching this video. The Ranma series is strong especially for fans like me and I must say that this is an excellent addition to the series! With the growing cast and silly predicaments, along with the humor makes this episode must be seen. "
1,"Disappointed: Very small wipes canister, not very wet, small wipes, hard to pull out of container. With that said, I like the ingredients and the idea, but keep working on the formulation and engineering of packaging."
1,"Great book, Great price: I won't try to write a better review, I couldn't improve on what's been written. I just wanted to add my vote for a great book with an incredible price. Best 99 book I have yet seen!"
1,"Is this spirituality?: The idea that there are really angels out there, and one is assigned to take care of us, is an extremely childish idea. All you have to do is look at the devastation around you, the pain and the needless suffering to convince you that it is not so. One can ask angels anything, we find out in this booklet, from a house to a car, a girlfriend or even a parking spot on a busy day. "
1,"Uplifting: This book was so inspiring; I now leave it beside my bed and read it every chance I get. If you feel depressed, Please read this book, you will feel a million times better. This book has changed my life. I know if I need help in a decision, there is always someone there to listen. If I need an answer to a question, I get it, even if it isn't what I want to hear..."
1,"Bad..Ok one more time; pay attention this time- BAAAAADDDD!!!!!!: Worst make of Nokia...I guess N3310 was far better than this one...No battery life...No internal phone memory..and even if u add a memory card, u cant transfer anything from it to the phone memory as it is very less...no ringtone compatibility, voicemail feature not proper...Camera is ok...Ringtone volume is good..But overall, STAY AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY FROM THIS PHONE!!!!! LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE...GOD BLESS U!!"
1,"this is not MIT...mostly: I first read this book when I got accepted to MIT. I have to admit that I was enamored by the difficulty and severity of it, but in reality only a very small percentage of MIT students could probably identify with White's character. His stories are interesting, but this is not an accurate representation of MIT or it's students in general."
1,Loved so much I got another color: I wear my sandals to work almost every day. I loved them so much I bought another pair in another color and am back looking for another.
1,"boring: I felt sorry for my daughter this past Summer. She picked this book out of a list of 5 to read for school. The writing was all over the place, the plot went nowhere. Really boring."
1,loser: at first i did not like the book but now i learned more! 
1,"a good book: this book over all was a good book. i've read better. it was an enjoyable book but it was sad, but i would've liked someone to warn me about it.it is also made for all kinds of ages because it is written in a very plain way, so younger kids can read it. But older kids might understand it better and get a deeper meaning out of it."
1,Large and not well-made: Was about 1 size too large.. It was expensive for such a cheaply made boot. It looked nicer in the picture than it do in reality. Buy a cheap work boot instead. I am keeping it just because it is too expensive to ship back. I will have to wear it with two pairs of socks. I should have ordered from Zappos with free returns.
1,"Three: No Doubt! This book has to be one of the best well written novels of this century. What a plot! What a plot twist! This book grabs you from the beginning, and keeps you holding on till the last page. Is there a dull moment? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! It begins about a young man who receives an anonymous cell phone call from one guy. Stating that he has 3 minutes to confess his sin, or he will blow up the car. Soon chaos erupts in his city. Does he know himself? This is a complete Black and White novel. Buy it!"
1,Love it!: It's perfect for any bathroom. No need to attach anything to a wall. It's attractive and well made - just what I was looking for.
1,"Review of Gundam Wing!: I Believe that gundam wing is one of the best Anime I've seen. I've seen a lot of them and well I'll always say these episodes are some of the best. If you enjoy great storylines, and if you like other action Anime. This is The best series to watch ."
1,"Works as it is supposed to: the nozzle works just like it is supposed to. The spray pattern is nicely symmetrical and evenly progressive as you press on the lever. It is all plastic, but seems to be quite sturdy."
1,"Not user friendly: For the price of this DVD, it should not require installation of special programming before a computer will play. The info contained is comprehensive, and closely mirrors the information contained in James Gurney's indispensible book, ""Color and Light.""Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter"
1,"Good information, but does not play on regular DVD players. There's a lot of good information here, but I had to install 2 programs from the CD-disk to get it to work on my computer.However, the 2 programs that were on the CD to make the disk play....they don't have a pause, FF or rewind function. You start it up and hope you don't get interrupted. If you have to stop it for any reason, you have to restart the CD from the beginning of any required content.I find it terribly misleading to call this a DVD.It will not play on ANY of the DVD players I have in my house. I find that to be really off-putting and probably would not have purchased it had I known ahead of time."
1,"Great Set of Tray Tables: My wife and I have put these tray tables to great use since we got them. They're very sturdy and easily big enough to hold plates, cups, etc. for a full meal. And they're very attractive -- the designs on the trays are a big plus compared to other plain tables. A great product for the money."
1,Bad: ...The drummer can barely keep time. There are some nice arrangements but I'd rather hear more competent musicians play them.
1,"The best show ever: Homicide was and is the best show ever aired on US television. The show was criminally ignored, barely escaped cancelation several times and was given a bad time slot, but still it survived on the quality of acting and writing in it.. "
1,"a wonderful series with no character development: I love gundam wing (can you tell)but I watch anime for Fights, Character depth, and plot. gundam wing has 2 of the three and it is very good"
1,"Ditto: The only thing I can add to the previous review is that the Smartmedia was well packaged. There is a statement with the card that says ""The Smartmedia has a limited life span, and will eventually become incapable of performing WRITE/ERASE functions after long-term use. When this happens please replace it with a new one."" If this is the case will all Smartmedia cards then what is long-term? "
1,"better than 1 and 2: i think the first CD is considerably better than the 2nd .many of the songs have a good backbeat with excellent female vocals perfect on the dance floor.  the best songs on the CD are: At the End (classic with great vocals)Diving (4 Strings in my opinion is always able to pull out a good song - Diving is one of my favorites)I Should Know (Despite the male vocalist, it was still a fairly good song, as it just gives you an overall good feeling)"
1,"Perfect for my needs: For some reason when I purchase these I thought they were zip lock bags. I was in a hurry to find clear plastic bags so I bought them without looking too closely. I actually just wanted a plain bag without a zipped top, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received them in the mail. Shipping was a little slow but they're high quality bags."
1,"Cute, Safe, and Solid: These are great little toys for the bath. Each is very detailed and cute. My daughter just loves to squirt water with them. They are a good size and safe as well, so I do not worry about her trying to swallow them. They are also strong. I believe they will last a long time unlike some of the cheap ones we have got in the past. Only downside was I felt it was a little pricy. However if they last, then it is was worth the money. My daughter loves them and plays with them almost every bath."
1,"Love These: My 15 month old daughter received these as a gift. They not only make great bath toys, but she carries them all over the house. By far these are a favorite."
1,"The most haunting retrospect of it's genre that I have seen.: This book has had a profound impact on my view of the war in Vietnam. Written from the perspective of ""One who was there"", I have been a part of the author's experience. No other book to date has had the same impact. I sense the truth in it's pages. The author has ""been there"". Truly one book that the reader of Vietnam War history should read. Clearly a masterpiece."
1,Very helpful for our RAV4: It takes some getting used to but this has been very helpful in eliminated a blind spot on the driver's side. We didn't use it on the passenger side as the mirror is already curved. I placed it in the lower left corner of the driver's side mirror. Would recommend especially given the modest price.
1,"Durable, Sleek, and a Great Value!: I've been drumming for over 6 years now and it is safe to say that this patch tops them all! Very easy application, looks very sleek, and holds up well!"
1,"Solid Gold: Wondering what's going on in the music business today and how you are going to survive and propser in the twenty-first century as a musician? Well, wonder no more. Peter Spellman's book is one of the best guides I've seen to the music industry. I wish I would have had a book like this when I was a starting my music career. Peter's insights into the wicked ways of the Big 5 are worth the price of the book alone. But there is so much more here, and readers will want to explore every chapter. This book is solid gold. Way to go, Peter!"
1,"Favorite Juice Glass: I originally bought a few of these glasses at my neighborhood grocery store. When I only had one left, I found I wanted more of them. I was delighted to find them at Amazon.com - not knowing what they were called or who made them - after doing a search for juice glasses. They are heavy and the thing I like the best is that they are 7 ounce glasses which makes them a little larger than the usual juice glass. You can't go wrong with this purchase!!!"
1,"If you liked ""Separate Ways"", you might not like this: I liked Teddy Thompson's last album, ""Separate Ways"", enough to buy it. The songs were catchy, not too long, and well-written. He has a pleasant voice as well.."
1,THIS PRODUCT WAS AS ADVERTISED AND FULFILLED MY EXPECTATIONS. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF NEEDED. AGAIN THIS PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED BY THIS REVIEWER.
1,"spice rack: I received this a gift and was suprised to find this on Amazon. It has very well chosen spices that we use almost everyday but especially weekends when we want to devote extra time to cookin desirable meals. You save money by buying groups of spices rather than individually, even if there are some you don’t use, its hard not to come out ahead."
1,Bought As A Gift: I got this for my husband to use in his shop. He said he likes it and uses it to work on our cars.
1,"Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product."
1,"Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. ""Dr Shen Fu"", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous."
1,"Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go."
1,TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking. I am very happy with it.
1,"Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids ."
1,"Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats."
1,one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
1,"Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation."
1,"Tha BOMB of a book!!: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!"
1,This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story.
1,"They'd watch it nonstop if I'd let them: apart from it arriving broken the first time, my kids are loving this DVD."
1,"Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London. I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since. which I am  fond of, it's an excellent book to read. "
1,"Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character. I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series."
1,No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
1,This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beginning and the end.
1,"An Engrossing and Chilling Read: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the ""evil"" Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give ""gifts"" to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say, I will be reading more of Cornwell's books, especially if they are at all like this novel."
1,Simply Awesome!: This was only my first Cornwell novel and I'm hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can't wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.
1,Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. 
1,I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent: West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
1,"A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe: A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's ""Shelters of Stone""."
1,The Scarlet Letter: I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
1,Good matt nude lipstick: It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. a nice color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
1,"Huh? The CD's over .boring. With the likes of a genious such as Ferry Corsten, I expected something more. There are only a handful of songs that redeemed this cd. I'm not saying that the songs on it are bad, but rather old and played out. If I have to hear Bt's Dreaming on one more CD this year, I'm gonna shoot myself. If you have a hard time going to sleep, this is the cd for you."
1,"a perfect book for beginers: If you are just getting started, or have been interested in knot work for a while, this is a great book! It provides historical information, diagrams, how to make circular knots, anamorphic, and more than 100 original knots, which include corners, borders, and motifs. This is the best knot book I've seen."
1,"When the box arrived, I read the book alone because I couldn't stand to wait. Ms. Rylant uses a nice collection of short and medium-length words for beginning readers, and the story rollicks along. Mr. Howard's illustrations contain beautifully shaped expressions. We checked these books out of the library so often that we finally ordered some to keep."
1,This book is OLD and nigh unto useless unless you frequently travel in time.
1,"not useful anymore: While this book seemed very appealing for someone who is new to Mac OS X server and its Linux underpinnings, it is almost worthless at this point in time since it has not been updated to include the major changes that have been made in the past couple years. Save your money and visit online resources; they are much more valuable."
1,MAC OS X SERVER Administrator's Guide: I was looking for a book that would be a guide to OSX Server since the information included with the software was thin at best. In all fairness I did pick up some information but it was not worth the price. I'll keep the book on the shelf but it will not be looked at .
0,"Buyers, be warned! I bought lamp of an  Ott Lite a year ago, and was using it for needlework. Then one day, it did not work. I bought a new bulb for it, and it still didn't work. I became in  the long line of people that bought from Ott and have expensive lights that no longer work. I'll never buy another Ott product again. Steer clear!"
1,Super.: This item is all I expected and more magnificence. no more back ache...Buy if u have a chance and get rid of back ache
1,I like this keyboard a lot!: My keyboard at work is so easy to use that I had to find something better for home. This one is actually really good for the price. It's not as flat as the one I have at work (sony vaio) but it is still really easy to use compared to most and it doesn't take up much room on my desk which is nice. I type extremely fast so I was looking for something that would keep up. The keys are fairly flat and light. I'm glad I bought it.
1,"Not for beginners!: There is way too much talking and detailed explanations. If you're looking for a quick yoga exercise, this DVD is not for you."
1,Cheap plasticy looking and can't see the light 3 feet away: Buy this if u have money to spend on junk stuff that you are no going to use. I never knew halogen light was so dull. I dont believe personally that this has a halogen bulb.
1,"I really love Puff Daddy and R. Kelly's songs.: I'm so happy they made this song together because having them together makes the song sound tight.It also reminds me of one of my best homegirls, Sheila."
0,"Very Disappointed: I expected more about how to create luck, maybe why people feel lucky and how they obtain it, not read pages and pages about luck in the casinos. Nothing really helped me in this book. Explaining others' Gambling and lucky streaks did nothing to help me and in fact bored me. Since I don't gamble, I thought I would scream when more and more pages about gambling began. This book was not what I expected at all. Very disappointed."
1,"Strange but, listenable: This is not what I expected. I thought this was an all out rock band and to my dismay I found noise "
1,"this is not music, no matter what anyone says. Its crap! anyone can make these tracks. to write an album like this you need the following: 1. no talent,. 2. loop a bunch of randomized drum beats, then put distortion on them. 3. have some idiot screaming with heavy distortion and a vocoder in the backround about death. 4. dont forget to tie yourslef in to the industrial scene. if you want real talent!? and still want that industrial noise? look up a band called ""the lack"" they kill!"
0,"Obey the warning: This is a fun toy and my 2 and 6 year olds love it. However, there is a very hard to read warning on the underside of the train that says that hair may become tangled in wheels. They are not kidding! I had to cut that train out of my two year olds hair when he picked it up off the track and lifted it too close to his head. It happened in an instant! It was a bit traumatic for both of us. Fun toy, but can be dangerous."
0,"Almost Great, Until it Broke...: My son recieved this as a birthday gift 2 months ago. He LOVED it even though it didn't corner well on the train track. He mostly let it run on the floor, not the track, so that wasn't that big of an issue. It did, however, break after it  felled down . My son let it drive off the kitchen counter and after only 2 short months it is officially broken. It can still be played with but because it is meant to be motor driven it doesn't work that well as a push-powered train. Overall I'm disappointed, a toy that only last 2 months just isn't worth it."
1,"Disappointed !!!: I bought this toy for my son who loves the ""Thomas"" toys. You need one battery to operate the train and it seems to work well - it can pull other cars quite weel and climb up and down the tracks. However, what I was not happy with was the advertizing on the box - which clearly stated that the toy can be also be pushed manually by the child. THIS IS NOT TRUE (unless I had two faulty trains)!! My son likes to watch the train pull the cars on its own, but he also like to the the pushing himself. You are not able to do that with this train. It is just meant for watching."
1,"Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie."
1,"This is a compilation of a wide range of Mitford's articles, the best of which, such as her skewering of the ""Famous Writers' School"", are timeless classics. This is a superb collection, and a complete delight to read."
1,"This DVD will be a disappointment if you get it hoping to see some substantial portion of the acts of the various comics listed on the cover. All you get here are snippets of performance, at best. The rest is just loose-leaf reminiscence about the good old days in Boston, in the early 80's, when a lot of comics were hanging out.It's like a frat house reunion. There's a lot of lame nostalgia. There are quite a few guffaws recalling jokes (practical and otherwise)perpetrated - back then. But you had to have been there to appreciate all the basically good ol' boy camaraderie. If you weren't actually a part of that scene, all this joshing and jostling will fall flat.If you want to actually hear some of these comics' routines - you will have to look elsewhere."
1,"Works great!!: I purchased the item hoping that it would fit my plan, which I purchased used and was about 8 years old..Buy this item, it will save you tons of time cleaning up"
0,A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
1,"Big things in small package: When I purchased this small hardcover book, I didn't expect very much. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.LBW is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship.This is a must read that is well-written and culturally enlightening."
1,"Nice but Sony must give us more info: This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information"
0,"I love romantic adventure books, and this went on until it turned out that the man I dreamed of was horrible! I was shocked when I finished reading the book and wanted to cry. I interacted with the book a lot. It was well written, but the ending was disappointing."
0,"This book was extremely childish. Having read it cover to cover, I felt that I wasted my money, as I was looking for something that had a reasonable amount of biographical information. Perhaps the mistake was mine in not reading reviews more closely. I have a 13-year-old granddaughter to whom I will be giving this book; however, I suspect it will be well below her age level, as well."
0,"Very short life for brake light: Put these in and after less than two months, the brake light portion stopped working..pretty important part of the bulb. Went back to regular bulbs."
0,"Great words interrupted by the inane compiler: This book contains a lot of great quotes from great and not-so-great women throughout history. Also, the so-called ""Index"" is actually only an index of authors - useless for finding a quote by a topic or keyword.I've seen most of these quotes elsewhere in more accessible form . Save your money and get a good book instead."
0,"No fruit flavor: I bought 6 bottles of this oil at a reasonable price. I was hoping for an oil that tastes fruit oil. This brand has not. I will use this oil for frying, but not for salad."
0,"I bought two sets of Sanyo batteries more than six months ago. These batteries lose charge very quickly when they are not in use in less than a month, and I am dissatisfied and very dissatisfied with this purchase. I think there are better batteries on the market with longer charging times for me, and it wasn't worth spending money on these batteries."
0,"Avoid it and don't buy it: After a few months of use, it has no value for use in a digital camera that requires 2500 mA. A waste of money."
0,"we have replaced 3 batteries in this keyless entry doorlock 3 times in less than 3 months.  yet something is using up the battery power. I LOVED this product,,until the battery issue. I am going to see if the store will exchange it,, and try again. If problem continues, I will go back to old regular keyed door lock."
0,"My whole family loved having a keyless entry lock - and it was easy to put in custom codes for various family members. However, after the first rainstorm it stopped working. Dried out after a couple of days and started working again - until the next rainstorm. Disappointed that a lock from such a well respected name brand performs this poorly."
0,tasteless. Very disappointed: I love this kind of cheese. It is one of the most attractive things in spaghetti. . I asked for it recently but it was not like previous experience. Tasteless - while this type of cheese is usually very refreshing. I will try a different brand.
0,Do not buy this or put one on your wrist: It caused me great allergy after wearing it for two days. Even after removing it it took months to completely recover.It's a very bad bracelet.
0,"This game has a lot of fun but is finally boring. It lacks adventure, although it contains many levels .. I suggest you rent it before you buy it."
0,"This filter not only made my screen have more glare, but it is so big and bulky and the bottom clips kept falling off. it will be in the garbage ! it is so bad"
0,"I bought this phone as a gift for my mother and I was very disappointed. The worst phone I've ever used. The reception is awful whenever it is used near the televisions. I see that other clients have faced the same problem, which leads me to believe that these problems are inherent in this model and that the price is being reduced in order to liquidate the stock. Think twice about buying this phone, pay a little more, and choose a different model."
0,This blender is a real piece of junk.  Replaced the internal fuse. Blew it again. And again. Not worth the effort. Don't get this blender.
0,False product: The perfume I got smells really similar to the real Dior addict but I think it is imitation perfume. It's a different color and smells slightly different. If I wouldve known I would get this I would've just gone to the mall and got the REAL stuff.
0,"Truly Awful: I am very easily entertained and can find something good to say about most movies. This movie however, could possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen. In all fairess, I couldn't make it through the whole thing as it was just too terrible. I could have made a better movie on my camcorder."
0,"bad design makes the  travel trip extremely frustrating: The flimsy blue bottom parts make this game frustrating, even for older kids. Don't waste your money. We could barely keep it working upright at home, let alone on the road!"
0,Did not  love this and my 20 month baby old could have cared less about them. They look cheap and well.... not very attractive.
0,Nightlight: Keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Nice lamp. But it does not continue lighting. The control switch is somehow defective. I had to fix it. I even got a lamp that I think is so cool!
0,"Cheap Bulb,The light is cute. This light also got so hot that the bulb went out in an hour. This light was intended for my son's room, but won’t work for that if it won’t stay lit."
0,"Not what I expected ... VERY disappointed: story too depressing, sordid, vulgar. I bought it to read on the train. . I tossed it in a 40 gallon drum at the train station when I got to page 17 or 25 or whatever ... don't remember.  Definitely not what I want to invest time on"
0,"Poor fan: The fan never worked well (didn't turn freely and was horribly noisy), and it conked out completely a month after the warranty expired."
0,"One of the worst films ever!!: I bought this DVD hoping that it will be a good one but it turned out to be awful and trashy. There is no story or plot to it, so I ended up throwing it away. I really regret buying it.let me tell , it is boring like hell."
0,"Horrible: I thought i was purchasing a documentary on the history of motion pictures. What I got was a bunch of old movie clips, in a horrible 2 dvd set that looks like a bootleg copy. "
0,JUNK: This is one of the most pretentious pieces of junk I've read in quite some time. This novel has gotten a lot of bad reviews. Save yourself of a few wasted hours and skip this.
0,"Terrible product - totally defective: I bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective! After a few days, they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down. This product is a piece of junk."
0,"uncomfortable  : these are the worst boots ever! they are sooo uncomfortable,blisters everywhere! the heel is too high, the buckle make noise when you walk. waste of money!"
0,Did not arrive on time: The primary reason I ordered this product is that it would be delivered as scheduled. It did not arrive and there appears to be now way to predict when it will.
0,The smell of this stuff is bad and will make your room smell dirtier rather than cleaner. It is also not a very good detergent. I don't think that this cleans any better than plain water. The only good thing about this product is that you can use it on any hard floor surface rather than changing detergents for different types of flooring..
0,"Home printing at its worst: If you are thinking of buying this book, save your money. Neither the research into this subject nor the quality of the printing is worth it. The book appears to be a cut-and-paste collection of images that appeared in antique books. The quality is so poor that many of the black-and-white images are blurry (low resolution on computer scanner?)and show black lines at the edges like a poor photocopy. Nor is the book comprehensive. All in all this book seems to have been published at home...."
0,dont buy it: you must use lexmark ink no other ink will work with this printer.i had for two years.cant not waite to get rid of it.
0,They changed their design to speed up the water filtering and caused lots of black dust getting into the water. If you check the water  you would find lots of them. not good any more
0,Dont buy this iron: The iron shuts off while in use. You cant started again without unplugging it. Worse iron we have owned.
0,"I was ironing when this iron suddenly stopped working. The indicator light went dark, and I have to get a new iron. This happened only 16 months after I purchased it. Other than this fact, I have no other complains."
0,This iron is useless for cotton. Even using ironing laxatives. Ironing is difficult and clothes are not wrinkled. I am sorry for the money you spent on this cold iron.
0,Don't buy this iron: I absolutely hate this iron. It doesn't get hot enough to take the wrinkles out of the clothes. I must say that whoever designed this iron apparently never tried it. . Time to find a new engineer to make a better product!
0,"Worked great....until it quit!: I bought this iron and really loved it at first. Light weight and lots of steam. Until one morning I went to turn the iron on and nothing happened. I thought it might be a bad plug, so I moved to another plug end. This iron is completely dead. It has not been dropped or misused in any way. I will never buy an iron from this company again."
0,I received this product and was very disappointed. It does not look like a product manufactured by a publishing company. Instead it is a bunch of photocopied pages bound the same way you would see a buisness report. I could have easily made this on my home computer. Very unprofessional. not what I expected
0,"Very poor movie i bought from amazon because it is cheap. I only spent a few dollars, but after an hour and a half in my life I will never go back to it."
0,"This movie is terrible and should not have been made. The characters are unbelievable, incredible and cannot be sympathetic. I left this movie less than five minutes after watching it. Do not buy it."
0,The fridge came in a box. It was heavily influenced by the upper corner. Looks really bad. I am very upset with her condition. I really like I don't like to pay nearly $ 200 for a fridge that has not been shipped with any protection and arrived damaged.
0,I should've bought more expensive scales . This one is as bad as regular digital scales . The weight fluctuates wildly according to scale on subsequent tries. After awhile the numbers on LCD display just began to run wildly never stopping at all. . Very strange. . Again I suspect in was defective unit.
0,"Not so good: Not only did this filter make my screen have more glares, but it is too big and bulky, but the lower parts of it continue to fall off. Do not bother with it."
0,"An insight into madness: I have never read such an abominable travesty as this work. I really believe that the author must be mad. . Don't waste your time, money or the paper this book is printed on."
0,"Tiny, tiny, tiny: Believe me, this thing is small. On the web it looks normal size, but it's soooo small an ant couldn't even use it. Anyway, I don't have it yet, but I was told about it everywhere. I mean, the box looks cool and everything but the size sucks. I wish they made a normal sized one for a lower price."
0,"I got this scooter for my son (who is 2 yrs.)   . He doesn't like this scooter at all, he does 3 steps on it and he wants me to carry it. It's hard for him to keep pushing and pushing. Very disappointing and waste of money."
0,"It will definitely be broken. I know that the comments for this product relate to the product itself and not to the service. However, since there is only one seller selling this product on Amazon, in this case I will say something related to the packing quality. The packaging opened and it was completely broken, so I didn't accept and return the shipment, it is unfortunate because the item is beautiful but this seller has no logical sense on how to pack fragile things. The packing was very poor."
0,"This case is overpriced. I received today, it looks like a cheap and shiny plastic. Not a skin, that's for sure. It may be $ 15 to $ 20, but I paid $ 45. It is supposed to get free from this store when making a $ 100 purchase."
0,"Just talk: I gave up in the middle of this novel, I no longer care. This novel is boring, boring, boring, a lot of historical references, I had no feeling that I interacted with it, nor a sense of the realism of the characters mentioned in this novel."
0,"Wrong information from an incorrect source: This book, instead of looking at the real evidence, plunges into inventing conspiracy theories and naming names. ... much lacks linguistic and analytical ability, not good to start with in the field of analysis."
0,"Dishwasher clogged: I have been using another type of this grocery product and loved it, but this is not the same at all. The washing machine is clogged and can no longer clean the dishes. I will never buy this product again."
0,"Be Careful - Health Hazard: As I was unpacking one tab to place in the dishwasher, s very small fragment from the concentrated detergent landed in my eye. The sharpest pain I ever had in my life."
0,"Sounds good, but not at all acceptable !!: I bought this phone as a gift for my mom and I was very disappointed. The worst phone I've ever used. The reception / range was awful whenever it was used near the televisions. . I had confidence in this type of phone and found that the significant price cuts were not a cause for concern, but I was very wrong. I see that other clients have faced the same problem, which leads me to believe that these problems are inherent in this model and that the price is being reduced in order to liquidate the stock. Think twice about buying this phone, pay a little more, and choose a different model."
0,"Its depend on your perception: This is the game where every person will have different opinion. If you like this type of game, you'll like it so much. If you hate it, you'll hate it so much. I'm in the second category. Some people like this game but not me.  . Better try before you buy. Yes, I think this game is overated"
0,Don't buy it.: This   phone is even worse than my 10-year old  phone. I returned it the next day after trying a couple of phone calls. The reception is absolutely lousy . this company  should toss this model out along with its engineers who developed this phone.
0,"This album does not contain any talent. It is just a large group of singers who support a young singer. Most of the time I can't even hear her singing. All the singer does is creaking and longing, creaking and longing. Her songs are tasteless and meaningless. So, I urge you to ask yourself about the need for this truly unfortunate catastrophic album before you waste your money. """
0,"This music album is fine, I just don't like the singer's voice and her style of singing, perhaps because the songs were easy to sing, in which she had no show of her talent. There is room for improvement."
0,"terrible! i borrowed the cd to listen to, and believe me, it's the last time i'll ever listen to it. all of her songs seem so fake, like she's trying to be too cute. very very bad."
0,"The fan never worked well (didn't turn freely and was horribly noisy), and it conked out completely a month after the warranty expired.it is so bad."
0,"I expected to have four DVDs already playing, the first disc not working. It is really disappointing."
0,"I can't play a DVD in my car, it just stops working once I start playing it, it's bad quality. I am upset about that."
0,"Terrible product - totally defective: I bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective! After a few days, they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down. This product is a piece of junk."
0,"I received the fragrance 3 days after ordering it. I was amazed at how quickly I received it, and the problem started when I tested the fragrance, it smelled like pure alcohol, and I am very disappointed with its quality, and it looks like a cheap imitation that can be easily found on the streets for $ 10 or less. I am very disappointed."
0,"I was very disappointed in this CD, it has many problems and errors, especially the poor sound."
0,"I bought this game, but it turns out that the screen is so dark that you can't see what's in it. Technical support staff told me to return it, and I shipped it back to the company, and after several weeks, I returned it with a note saying that there was nothing wrong with that. I turned it on, and it didn't work. No one should ever buy this product, it is a piece of scrap. I will give zero stars to this product. Or minus the stars if you can. It is waste of money "
0,Waste of money: I do not think these are as good as they should be I feel like I just wasted my money
0,"I bought these two electronic notes for my father so that he could take notes for himself. One for the home and the other to carry in his pocket. He opened the package and put the batteries and neither of them worked. They are just a piece of junk, something really unfortunate"
0,"Too bad, they used the cheapest material possible in its manufacture, so it is not durable. Also the recorder is not good."
0,Terrible service: I never got my DVD from this vendor  That sucks! they should send the product or refund my money. I hope they do something about this Issue!
0,"I agree with the comments that gave the book two stars. The author believes that he did something impressive, but he did not do very well. The author did not go into sufficient detail on each topic. . This author needs to delve into his topic. He clearly has not done enough research on the topics he has brought up"
0,"Digital video camera, worked for about 30 minutes before being broken. Its price is overrated, its look is not good and it was not a solid electronics. The camera stopped working about half an hour after turning it on. It would be better to buy one of the many cheap camcorders, likely to last longer."
0,"Although this book aims to do something impressive, it does not do that well. It covers a lot of ground, and doesn't spend much time getting into specifics about each component involved. This is actually just a nice book for your coffee table - not a serious book on earth science."
0,I bought this baby sitting chair (seated) for my second child and I was very disappointed. I had a cheap one for my first child and it was awesome. The second chair looks very luxurious but has a problem that it does not vibrate and does not bounce too much. Not worth the money you spent on it. Great loss.
0,"I was disappointed with this product. Firstly, it is heavy and difficult to move from one place to another with one hand (as is often the case when you have to do things on its own with a new baby!) Secondly, it breaks down and stops the rocking chair after just 3 weeks of use,. The only good thing about it was that the Customer Service department was and will send me a replacement chair. """
0,"I do not recommend this product. Not equal to one dollar. It is complex and requires multiple steps and supplies. It did not repair the DVDs that I tried to fix. It did a good job cleaning the DVDs, but it didn't fix the scratches."
0,"The top cover of the product easily breaks the product even with simple light use, and it is difficult to use the machine in this case, which makes it not worth the special high price paid for shipping."
0,"While this device is a little better than the $ 39.00 CD polishers, it lacks power and heats the CDs causing peeling of the thin data layer. This device is not worth it."
0,"Although some of the stories are interesting in this book, his rating is below average. Its title is not related to the content, its title is deceptive and misleading."
0,Did not find this useful at all. I would not recommend and would not waste time or money on this book.bad book
0,"This is a clear example of the music's inconsistency with the written words. I was disappointed. This was never looked for. I like strong emotional music. But this music is painful, annoying, just noise - for me."
0,This song is so bad that it is not so funny that it is tragic. Lyrics are weak and the music is very old. A weak and boring mix.
0,"It looks beautiful when received, but badly rusted when using it. It is useless now. Obviously, this is not solid copper. I will not buy any copper items from this store again"
0,"This piece looks great outside the box, but it rusts within 24 hours after I put water on it. Since then it has deteriorated badly and is likely to be toxic to birds. Save your money and buy something of good quality."
0,"I have many cookbooks that I love, but this is not one of them. Recipes require ingredients that are not readily available. The only recipe I loved was chicken and rice soup, it was great. I was very disappointed with this book, which they gifted me"

0,This book started well and then turned into a mess of repetition of words. This book does not deserve to be completed. Very boring
0,"I was really disappointed in this book. I'm more interested than ever in World War II - but this was mostly boring and seemed to be stuffing for pages that tried to support the shaky plot. I am a fan of this type of book, but this book made me sleep."

0,"This book looks like an unofficial book, it is poorly written . I don’t know how real it can be. I think this book deserves a (-1000) star"
0,There was a deep and bad scratch on the ring. I brought it back and bought one from a store that guarantees the product for life. I think it is the best option.
0,"As much as I wanted to love this product, I can't stand the bad smell it emits, it stays warm for about 15 minutes, and that's fine, but it smells like dead cat.bad smell"
0,"This product is not what is advertised. It was requested as a gift .. until I opened the gift and realized that Amazon wrongly announced the product.

0,"Boring, boring, boring. Did you mention it boring? I will not say that this is a bad movie, but it is definitely a movie for young children ..

0,This was a very boring and slow movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! Do not waste your money on anything for no use!

1,"This is a great video of snowboarding, great shots, but I liked the music, what a hell of a comeback."

1,"this great book is   a very useful tool for real estate agents, & the letter templates are good. My only complaint is that they have a floppy disk included in the back of the book to download the forms onto your computer. If it had been a cd instead of a floppy, it would have been much better.  but some computers don't even come with floppy drives anymore. If they'd switch to a cd, then it will be great."

1,"There is a LOT of knowledge shared by the author in this book! There are many different facets of our conversation and body language described.

1,"One word ... cool !!, this is a wonderful book. Perfect recipes and great ideas. If you like tea parties, this book is a must. I highly recommend it. """
1,"I am amazed at how fast this device works, as it takes other similar products from one to two minutes to clean them in the same amount of steps, for medium scratches, a great product. What makes this product on the top of my list is that when a part is broken, you can order an alternative to everything on their website, and that's a great helpful feature for me."

Nice narration and helpful references if you want to explore topics in more detail. """
1,"I enjoy the music on these CDs. They cheer me up; They make me smile, and as is often the case, they give me something to think about. The songs in this set go back to 1969-73, and they are all fine. If you are interested in e Macintosh music then this CD will be very interesting for you."

1,"This is a very interesting book to consider. Large color images abound along with an easy-to-understand organization and simple, brief descriptions. This book allows buildings to speak through images instead of pages and pages of complex text. """
1,"I've always hesitated to buy this CD because of all those bad stuff about the singer . I bought it recently, It's a really good album! Her songs are upbeat .This is a great Cd for any music fan!  If you like the music, then go ahead and get it, it's all about music!"""
1,the cd has great songs and i can always listen to it: i love the song crazy because it make makes me in a good mode and just drives me crazy.
1,Lovely reusable grocery bags: I have one in the stroller and the other one in the grocery cart. I have been looking for a product like this and it fits perfectly.
1,Great Goggles: The goggles are terrific. They really keep the sun and glare away and provide very clear views underwater. They are a little hard to adjust though.
1,"These glasses are elegant and offer a wide viewing range. Good for the money you paid. One downside is its fog and design, which leaves a temporary mark around your eyes. In general, it is worth."
1,"My 8-month old cat is absolutely entranced by this toy . The spinning feathers are amazing and really do sound like a bird. this toy makes my cat move like I've never seen him move! He darts around, leaps into the air, and runs like crazy. (He did these things with his other toys, but never with such enthusiasm and determination.) It makes me happy to see him so happy! The attachments are also great; the big fluffy feather is perfect for dragging over the floor to make him pounce on it. I can't wait to try some other attachments too. Awesome toy for a great price."
1,"Great overview of herbs, their magic, medicinal uses, and more. A great book for those who wonder about herbs. Is it real? What is it used for? This book will tell you this and much more! It is a wonderful, interesting and useful book."
1,"Its the best game i have ever bought!  great thrilling split screen! Graphics are awesome,its the best game money can buy."
1,Clean Clean Clean: A lot of this powder removes everything. The dishes never looked clean! The extra cleaning of the ball seems to remove anything stuck very well. It is an excellent and great cleaning powder
1,"Excellent service, good price / value and exact product as advertised. You will love doing business with this seller for other purchases."
1,"Home Bread!: Delicious! There is no substitute for home-made flavors of fresh bread and cakes. These recipes are easy to follow and easy to make. The potato bread recipe is my personal favorite, and I also love bran cakes too!"
1,Reading this book was like watching a classic black and white film. This book opens all aspects of mind and puts you in a wonderful position of hopes and dreams. Gorgeous! great work!
1,the ultimate review: this toy is the greatest toy i have ever played with. every time i played with it was a new adventure.
1,"I bought two of these piggy banks for my children. It's really cool, really pretty, much bigger than I expected. It arrived by shipping very quickly. The packaging was perfect and it didn't get damaged. Something really happy."
1,"A beautiful, interesting book.: A beautiful, interesting book on the subject of the use of dark mirrors in magic practices and as a visual, reflective tool in artistic image making for the old master painters of the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Made me want to buy my own obsidian magic mirror! Nice photo illustrations. Book received in fine condition."
1,Very happy with the scooter for my 2 year old. It is perfect for her age. Unhappy that I paid for shipping through Amazon  . I got nervous with his birthday approaching and paid the shipping. The total being $50.
1,This is a sturdy Great toy and worth the price. My grandson loves this Scooter. It was easy to assemble and very well made.
1,"I purchased three of these scooters for my sons . nice and compact for storage. Though none of them have ever ridden a scooter before, it took no time at all for them to use it out. The wide foot pad is great for little feet to stand on and they maintain great control with them. We've always been pleased with this Great toy!"
1,"This game is excellent and great! I have played it a few times before, but when i received it today it had some cracks, but the game itself is very fun."
1,"The is a well built sander. The portability makes it easy to use on large pieces. The one thing that I would recommend is to have a handle. This sander is somewhat bulky and a handle would make it more ergonomic. If a handle were to be added, I would rate it five stars."
1,"Let me first say that I love this TV. It has a great  and  beautiful picture. It has a nice design . However, it has a fatal flaw. If you watch television at night or in a dark room the picture gets cloudy. . This is particluarly distracting when viewing darker scenes. . A television set that costs over three thousand dollars should not have these problems."
1,"Quintessential Reference Book: If you are a biologist or botanist, you already know this book! If you are interested in learning about what you see in the fields, this book is the essential reference book. It is comprehensive and a great reference book."
1,"A well written book. Didn't want to put it down. I loved it especially the end. Discovering things you did not know about your family may be global, but it is rarely discussed."
1,"This is a powerful first, passionate debut artist and talented songwriter. An impressive variety of chants. I hope to see more of this artist."
1,I bought this lovely little cable to throw in my portable bag. It is the perfect way to connect with micro USB devices on the go.
1,"I loved this book. it is on the happy side of things, the photos look kind of funny; the language can sound kind of silly. The mindset described in this book is wonderful, and it also contains lots of very valuable information as well. I just adore it! I'll be reading it again and again. Wonderful book!"
1,"Great Product: I bought this as a gift for my sister, she loved it! It was a lot best and  cheaper on amazon"
1,"Amazing!!: I totally enjoyed every minute I spent reading this book. As soon as I finished it, I started it again. It's packed with so much interesting information. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the behind the scenes information on these old songs and their creators. .AMAZING!!"
1,Excellent film;  We have watched this film several times and enjoyed it more each time.wonderful  film
1,"Great quality and in good condition: This product arrived in excellent condition, excellent quality and fast delivery time through Amazon Prime. The book itself is very cool but also very sad"
1,"My Wonderful tv arrived without any scratches or issues. Being technologically illiterate I was a little intimidated by the instructions but it ended up being super easy to set up.  the product works fine. At times the tv may freeze and the dvd freezes too sometimes, but not enough to get you annoyed or frustrated. I'm really pleased!"
1,Very happy to have this resource in search of family history. It was presented to me as a great gift for the whole family! thank you!
1,"Brita filters make the water taste just like bottled water. without expense.  Additionally, using the brita filter is so easy, cost effective and you can get a real sense for contributing to reducing the number of water bottles in our landfills."
1,"I have been using Brita products for years as it works well. The only issue is packing. Filters are placed and filled in a chaotic way, so that they look like used filters ....."
1,"Fun and educational: An excellent, fun and educational book for children five years and older. Great for science teachers and parents to explore unique educational science projects."
1,"The bracelet of this watch is not elastic at all. It is solid, uncomfortable at all. I was very disappointed to buy it"
1,Magna tiles: My daughters love this product. Durable and clean up easily. Would recommend to parents & grandparents as gift idea at any age.
1,Looks Good. Priced Right.: This product looks good on the wrist. Its easy to put on with the installation tool that is not included. The price was good.
1,"Good mystery.: An atypical hero, but interesting character. Good mystery, took a little while to figure it out. Worth your while for a light read."
1,"For this free book, it was so pretty: I thought when I downloaded it for free it was going to be awful!!It was pretty good, kept me interested until the end."
1,"The journal thats outstanding!: It makes you feel like you're Ben when you read the book it's scary, sad ,and great."
1,Very Warm: These overcoat are very warm and keep you that way in the coldest weather conditions. Excellent   as well as high functionality.
1,"BUY IT!: Its the best game i have ever bought!  Graphics are awesome, its the best game money can buy."
1,"Plenty of fun..gets boring in the end: this game was alright..wasnt the best..it had more levels .then the fisrt sonic adventure.. the only thing this one was missing was the adventure field, but for sure this is a better game then the fisrt one.. id suggest rent it fisrt before buyin it though"
1,Sweet Music: This album reminds me of my college years during which this was published. The tunes are nostalgic for me. I like them.
1,"Unfortunately, after one use, the  smallest of the bowls started coming apart around the rim. I had used it to beat some whipping cream, and expected it to be far more user friendly. Other than that, I am happy with the set so far."
1,"Thriller from beginning to end: I read this book from beginning to end. It started off slow but as the suspense got more and more exciting I could not put the book down. I,m looking forward to the  new book of  this author ."
1,"What a great song!: I really enjoyed listening to this! It's sad but really good, I would recommend it to anyone."
1,This bowl is the first bowl that I have ever used in my life that fits so well in my hands and is a pleasure to use . I love  it  and I would recommend this bowl. . I am so glad that I decided to purchase this bowl.
1,Adorable and arrived in lightning speed time!: I sent this to my brothers  . They totally thought it was adorable and the perfect size. The shipping time was so fast and I didn't pay for expedited shipping! Would order again next year if the need comes up!
1,"Good cookbook, and more.: This is more than a cookbook. The author adds some great comment on the food and good advice on  cookware."
1,Excellent buy for the money: Recently bought this filter for my small bedroom in my apartment. It has been absolutely great for my allergies. Quiet on the low setting and very fast to clear the room on the high setting. Easily the best buy for a small room
1,"The only complete guide I’ve found: This book is best and only good guide I’ve found for finding the steeps in the Himalayas. Well written, great route descriptions, it's exactly what I’ve been looking for my ski trip next year. I recommend it highly"
1,I LOVE this grill!: I use this more than I use my oven! I love it and the timer makes life SO much easier! It's also a beautiful addition to my kitchen.
1,"Works great: I have it installed on my computer . So far, we've had no issues at all, and it appears to have decent speeds."
1,Great game for a great price: This game was great. My son loves it and I was pleased with the price. I was unable to find the game in stores (where they were selling for much higher.)
1,"Great Game: This game is really fun. The graphics are good.. The best thing about this game is that you can create your own design, to enjoy the park. there are really cool new features, like making waterfalls and new scenery items. A really good game"
0,Dull and dirty: Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd.
0,"This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality."
0,"Works great, and half the price: This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15"" Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad)."
0,"Disappointing Misrepresentation: Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book. It is an exceptionally well written that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name. When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [supposedly of the full series I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [only 8 shows from this far more extensive series. What a misleading disappointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherwise. Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.  However, the nature of this post is ""Buyer beware"""
0,"Do Not Buy This Software!: I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: this software makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept the receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software..."
0,"Worst Night World book: This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine [Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero [Thierry is the best]. He is stupid [he cheated on the SATs].If you haven't read any of the Night World books, don't start with this one."
0,"Worst book I've ever read: This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I ""attempted"" to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by this author."
0,Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
0,"Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord: This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging. I’ve returned this cord and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
0,"garbage: Complete garbage, the sound quality is horrible, if you’re going to release a best of cd, record it with something other than this microphone covered with a wet rag."
0,"Good product at reasonable price: Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply, it seems to work fine--and it is very reasonably priced. Too bad that Amazon stopped carrying the supply."
0,"If you're tempted to throw away $30....: I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly .I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead."
0,"Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work. Consider yourself warned."
0,"Stopped Working Day 3: Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten.. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home. The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of bad packaging doesn't void my refund. I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear."
0,Not what I expected: I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing(classical female singing voice)
0,"Please Listen to Me...Don't buy this product!: I've had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I'd give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony  for over four hours, I still can't the thing to work. There's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can't use it at all. If I were you, I'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)"
0,"book only, no jacks: I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!"
0,Worthless: Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
0,"Disturbing.: If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page. Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish."
0,"Not Very good: I don’t advise buying this grinder, it broken when i pressed it. The plastic is very fragile and don’t support the pressure required for grinding the pepper."
0,"Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing thing."
0,"Don't buy this Junk: Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk."
0,"Disappointed: This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice Required exercises. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to ""freestyle"" and ""improvisation"". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish."
0,I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
0,"I won't buy one again: I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in ""best"" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!"
0,Course Book: Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
0,"Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I wish there was a way to fix it."
0,"As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it is ineffective."
0,"Poor substitute for an iPod: Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap."
0,Product key didn't work: The product key didn't work and this XP program was too expensive. Return it when the product key does not work. I went to a local computer store and bought XP with SP3 for 60 buck
0,". Poor: In order to install XP Home Edition, I had to connect to the Internet first. Secondly, I thought I requested the professional version but I received the main version. Third, I had to pay $ 129.00 to the morbid squad to download the software to my new computer, and the software is clearly not designed for easy downloading; in the past I used to buy additional software and it was very easy to download it to my home computer. If I had known this, I would have gone straight and bought the full version of Best Buy Circuit City, for example, because I didn't save a penny"

0,"Has Fructose in it! Bad for yeast overgrowth!: I have to go to another website to read all information on this product: dosage, servings, active and inactive ingredients. If you have a yeast problem, fructose/sugar is not recommended, otherwise I would have ordered it. Also, a bit pricey!"
0,"doesn't work: This works for a few days holding down the carpets, but then it stops sticking and the carpet doesn't stay... we use this for the small rugs in our entrance, and at the bottom of the stairs..."
0,"Big Disappointment: I expected a wonderful resource of Christmas tunes and their history, what I got was a miserable book with very little information, some of it completely wrong. It excludes many of the tunes because of copyright--for the price, they could have gotten permission--it is very easy to do--simply call the owner or write them a letter--most of the time there is no charge."
0,"Quite poor thriller: This is one of the worst thrillers / mysteries I have read. The characters are unbelievable, the dialogue is exceedingly disappointing .. what else can I say?"
0,"Pure garbage: This book,simply put...pure garbage. The author may have gone to a Christian Science church but never understood Christian Science. Don't waste your time reading this book about C.S. Read Mary Baker Eddy's, 'Science and Health', and judge for yourself."
0,"Not worth your time: Although my first review was deleted, I repeat that this book sadly misrepresents CS. The author has used a sensationalistic, attention-grabbing method to try and make people think that CS is evil. It is true it has many problems, but the only thing this author has done has applied psycho babble to ""prove"" her point. If you buy this book, I urge you to read other sources on Christian Science, both positive and negative, to gain a better understanding of this controversial religion. Regardless of your opinion or lack of opinion on Christian Science, don't just take this author's word for it. She's just way too biased to be believed."
0,I never liked this because the handle sticks up so high you can't put a lid on the pot unless you use a massive pot. I only use it once in a while but after only a few uses the legs started falling off. The thing is useless and broken after just a few months. This was a huge waste of money.
0,"Piece of Junk: This is a very poorly made steamer. It's nice that the legs are high but they bend from the base very easily, I always needed to straighten them before putting it in the pot. Then they eventually fell off. Mine is now in the trash. (I owned it for about 4 months with moderate usage.)The tall handle is good if you only plan to use it in large pots. I would have to unscrew the handle in order to use it in smaller pots and then try to screw it back in while trying to avoid being burned by the steam so I could take it out of the pot. I've found this to be a very frustrating steamer and I don't recommend it."
0,Garbage!: Pieces of the steamer came off when I lifted it out of the shipping container. Soon after one of the legs fell off. It's constructed so that you can't repair it. Unbelievable!. I'm furious!
0,"Disappointing: I thought this would be a great concept and opportunity for Bob Greene to motivate through each week of progress. There is very little motivational commentary and advice. A few simple diet rules at the beginning (nothing comprehensive) and then the weekly exercise program. I expected him to include motivational comments and add on additional nutritionally / diet goals each week. But nothing except for the weekly exercise programs. On the plus side, the exercise programs are short and easy to fit into your schedule. They change each week adding more challenge and variety."
0,worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
0,"To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game."
0,Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - The control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable .save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something.the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: I could only read the beginning 8 chapters. No excitement.
0,"one woman short: This was an okay book. It was not too exciting. Really, I mean it was bad . I was disappointed because I had just finished reading 10 straight good books. But this book was something to read if u have nothing else to do."
0,"Good, but only to the midway point: This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great "
0,"a terrible product: this is not well manufactured I received it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed .I put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS."
0,BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
0,Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
0,"Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind Wright and his works.. Not for collectors unless you like myself want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view."
0,"While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading."
0,"Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some over the past decade, but sadly they have not.. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than mistakes from the past."
0,"Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for."
0,"What a disappointment!: I am this author  fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another novel this author  in the future."
0,"You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now."
0,junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
0,Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
0,"Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time."
0,"None: Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed, smiled, and even got tears! A brand new favorite author."
0,"lousy, outdated guide, with horrible printing flaws!: First thing I noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together., really...they were. There were many pages that had to be hand cut just to TURN them. I could not stand the ... design. Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications .MIGHT be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually READ them."
0,Still yet to recieve: I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I've tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!
1,High level of sophistication. Smooth. Not easy to find a musician who plays a strange instrument with convincing skill.
0,broken : The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
0,"THIS CD is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE, AND IT REALLY bad !!!!! IF SOMEONE IS ITNERESTED IN BUYING THIS, DON'T, IT'S A WATSE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
0,"Nice but Sony must give us more info: This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information"
0,CUT IT UP DEF: IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
0,"I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send   the vacuum to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
0,"waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Squiggler fell apart at second use, with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard, horribly designed and made product!!!!!"
0,"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is the WORST movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very drawn out, absolutely NOTHING happens!!!!!!!! I sat thru the whole movie thinking ""Somebody blow up a car!""I can't believe. all that time and money making a movie that stupid! Don't waste your money on this stupid movie!!!!!!!"
0,Not so good in terms of Quality of the material: It took almost 24 days to get delievered to my house. Even after receieving it didnt stand upto my expectations..
0,Needs special Charger: I purchased 2 of these high powered batteries for my 5 year old toy  and received them just find out that I need a special charger which I cant find anywhere unless I buy an entirely new gun. It wood be nice if this info was posted on the site and not just on the box when I received it. The batteries were shipped in a timely fashion and in perfect shape. But only good for a one-time use since I cant charge them with my 15-min charger.
0,"MS Windows XP Full Edition: Product is great - works just like it should. Arrived quickly - like it should. I wish I didn't have to buy it twice, however. I first tried to purchase it from Tech For Less on Amazon - I received an OEM version with no product key. Received no replacement or refund from that seller. So I had to purchase it AGAIN - I chose to purchase it from Amazon, expecting that they would at least honor their own refund policy. Too bad they don't back up the sellers' return policies   on their site."
0,"Product failed after 2 weeks and no support: After only 2 weeks on, the product totally failed, and support is only open from 8-5  our country  time, so if you work, there's no way to get support. We got a form letter by email stating that we could ship the product back at our own cost, at our own risk, to get a replacement. I would definitely not recommend this product."
0,You get what you pay for: The vent clip broke the first time I tried to fit it in my car. You can't expect much for under $2 so at least you are not disappointed. The whole item is poor quality and not worth the shipping costs. I didn't even want to give it one star!
0,"A long winded story that should have been a short essay. This book would have had much better appeal if it were terse. Consequently, he fills in too many voids with uneeded detail that transforms a great short story into a book that is both long winded and boring."
0,"not finding comfort in food: I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However, this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self-confidence. It is not true, obviously. I am not overweight and never had any eating disorders, but I just don't have a positive self-image. So if you're like me, don't read this book. I couldn't relate to it. The title is misleading."
0,DVD player stopped worked: DVD player stopped working a month after the warranty expired. It costs $250 to repair the DVD. I would not recommend this product.
0,"Mastering Dreamweaver 3: In a few words, the title should be ""introduction to dreamweaver 3"". It was not at all what I wanted or expected. Very, very, very basic. The companion book that came with DW3 was more informative. I have the Dreamweaver 2 Bible and now have to go back to that book to guess about how the new feature in Dw3 would work."
0,Does NOT work with SDHC cards: Be aware that this card only works with some SD cards. It does NOT work with the more widely used SDHC cards.
0,"What a waste: Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something, but good luck with that. In-ear earbuds work so much better than these."
0,"Don't waste your money: After ordering these eargels, I spent an enormous amount of time trying to make them fit. It was useless. Unless you have elephant ears, or you wish to grease them and use a hammer to insert them, they won't work."
0,"TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!: This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star."
0,"Very disappointed: Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size is horrible. The bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the other sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again."
0,Not a good toy: This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal.
0,terrible: Unable to use on my television. Advertisement didn't advise me that it needed a special television to play this game.
0,"NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER: hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip, i was really dissapointed, it wasnt even 3 minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get ON FIRE!!!! melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is VERY UNSAFE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DONT PUT YOUR BABY IN DANGER IF YOU HAVE THIS PLUGGED IN YOUR CAR, CUS THE WARMER MIGHT GET ON FIRE, i hope this review helps you, i wont EVER buy this product EVER again."
0,"Waste of money: I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter)."
0,"Didn't Like it!!: Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? this isn't a look into the future. It's a look into Bradbury's twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don't waste your "
0,"DON'T READ THIS MIND-NUMBING DRIVEL!: This book doesn't deserve one star. It deserves negative 1000 stars. This was the WORST book I have ever read. The book moved to slow, and the characters are stupid., the main character, is a fireman who sets books on fire, becuase homes are fireproof. Then he meets crazy girl who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like (Did you know that one time billboards were only 20 feet long, instead of 200) WHO CARES?!?! If there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this."
0,I tried reading this book for my summer reading & it was bad: I am sorry this book did not make any sense. If you have a choice I wouldn't pick this one.
0,poor quality DVD recording: movies are okay but the video quality is poor.Is this a legit DVD or black market?They are watchable...but Not so clear.I guess you get what you pay for.
0,"Disappointed: I am sure the story is fine, but the disk is imperfect, lost my packing slip and need to call to return it."
0,Not happy: I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????
0,"Did not fit in ear: I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear, in fact, after trying for a couple of weeks, I could not tell which one was the R and which was the L as they both fit so poorly. The spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing.I threw these out and purchased the Umbo earbud. Much, much better fit there."
0,Typical Thomas video: THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. The episode would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order.
0,"Do not buy this gun!!: I bought this gun for my son who was jealous because I have 2 other good paintball guns. What a disappointment it was when we went out to use this one. Out of every 3 shots we took, 1 of the paintballs would blow up inside the gun and you have to stop everything to clean it out. Once the mess builds up in the gun every shot you take explodes inside the gun. He literally told me he hates this gun. After the 2nd time we used it the whole cocking mechanism that makes up the inside of the gun got jammed and disconnected. I have no idea how to take it apart or put it back together. Total waste of money. Only used it twice and they both sucked. Save your money."
0,"This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality."
1,CO alarm: Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.
1,"Wordy: I bought the book for 3 reasonsThe book itself doesn't read easy. It contains a lot of text without telling much. I think the book could be reduced to 250 pages without losing the strength of it. The references in the book and some chapters were interesting. They inspired me to test some new ideas. The author knows his profession without any doubt, but I didn't get used to the way he wrote this book."
1,"Inspirational: As a photographer hobbyist, I found this book to be an inspiration. The idea of taking an area and photographing it over a long time to make it your own is a revelation. I've been inspired to try the same thing at a favorite canyon in my area. Great addition to every photographer's image library!"

1,Great Basic Start!: This book is a great start to a person interested in Music Therapy. The outlines of the treatment were a great help. The only thing I wish were included were certain techniques they used.
1,Excellent Book!: Very organized and detailed. I'm surprised all of this information can fit easily into one little book!
1,"Perfect Present :My daughter absolutely loves her new metronome. It easy to use, reliable, and provides multiple functions that cover all the instruments she plays in high school band."
1,"Very nice set!: It comes with a lot of useful, fun pieces. It is a little big for carrying to the beach with everything else that you always want to take, but it is lightweight so a nice beach bag should solve any problems."
1,"Awesome product: Fits my thick laptop with a 15.4"" screen perfectly. Even has a little pouch for the power brick. Perfect for those who dont want to lug around a heavy laptop case."
1,"why did i get married: hi tyler perry please don't stop making movies about husband, wife, and church. thank you"
1,Why Did I Get Married?: I thought that the movie pointed out some crucial points that everyone should consider before getting married. I thought the movie was outrageously funny and is definitely a pearl full of great wisdom and forsight. Bravo to Mr. Tyler Perry. A very good movie
1,"My daughter and I read this book nearly every night. It's a wonderful story about a mom and her daughter, bird lovers both, a story about exploration, courage, and doing what's right. The illustrations are captivating. And dust off your vocal cords, because you'll be singing like a bird before you turn the last page."
1,"Captivating story of a young girl naturalist and hero: My two-year old selected this at the library last week and I was put off a bit initially by the fact that it looked too sophisticated for her, but she LOVES this book and asks to be read it several times each day. It is a story that can be appreciated at many levels and ages--the creative illustrations are full of detail and characters; there are lots of interesting facts about birds provided, the plot is fairly simple, yet much of the language and humor is highly sophisticated. What I appreciate too is that this is a positive story about a mother and daughter team studying and protecting the natural world. I would also note that there are some minor inaccuracies regarding ecology and bird behavior."
1,"Fantastic Album!: I heard this album for the first time today and felt like I was listening to one of those live performances that you remember for the rest of your life. This recording does not feature any of popular songs but it doesn't matter. What it showcases is the incredible talent and the ability to electrify an audience, with  an outstanding band."
1,"My Best Friend!: This book is the best thing that has come into my life! I never leave home without it, as it is my guidance. With it, I have no excuse whatsoever to not watch what I eat. It definitely was my companion over the holidays. It has been 3 months since I stumbled onto the book and I have already lost 14 lbs!.keeping weight off is not an easy task for me. I thank the brilliant minds behind this book, as this book is helping me towards my goal. Thank you!!!"
1,"Best BookEver, You Have to Have This Book!: This is the best little book. It is simple to use, easy to read and has the most information packed in between its covers. Includes fats, carbs, calories and proteins. Great for a diabetic and awesome for those of us who want to be aware of what they are eating! Colored, easy to read pages, indexed very well! Also includes most popular restaurants so that you can actually see what you are about to eat. I buy a new one for every person I meet that is diabetic or who is about to embark on a diet. So much information in so little space! You have to have this book in your home!! You will LOVE it!"
1,A veritable smorgasbord of facts and figures on most foods. With this  book you can see how poorly you're eating and if you work on the basis that a 30 minute walk is going to burn 60 calories you'll certainly rethink your value meal upgrade next time around.
1,Terrific little book: This book fits inside your purse and is full of information..I update my book every 2 years. You'll love it!
1,I love this album it’s my second favorite to peaks and valleys. I envy his ability to communicate to people with such talent and tenderness. I enjoy his voice immensely and I am jealous that I can’t play the guitar like he can. He has insight and an intelligent person.
1,"Randomness, dysfunction, and a whole lot of crazy: A fun read. The main character (who is the least self-aware of the bunch) is set as the observer Which makes the storytelling style messy and random but yet really works well. The artwork is great.....very frenetic but also very playful."
1,"Great product!: durable, handy, perfect size, plenty of pockets. I use it to hold tools, tow strap, and jumper cables and throw in the back of my pickup. It works great!"
1,"This is one of my favorite candies. It's very chewy, and it tastes sort of citrusy, but sweet. It has an inner wrapper of rice paper that you can eat, it kind of melts in your mouth. Each pack of this candy comes with a very cute sticker. Worth getting."
1,"I ordered this cookbook in February and have made 6 or 7 of the recipes .Everyone has been tasty and not hard to prepare. There are symbols at the top of each recipe that alert you to quick or hot ones. Index guides me to recipes containing the ingredients I have on hand. Recipes use avariety of spices and herbs, which make them quite satisfying. The roasted vegetables and the Rosemary Chicken are our favorites so far."
1,Leather phone case: Excellent product overall. Shipping was very fast! My only complaint is that the phone needs to be removed from the case to use the camera option ... the hole in the case for the camera eye covers part of the eye..
1,Good quality tools!: I give the Clean-Up Kit 4 stars. Every item functions as it should and are made of high quality plastic. The extension wands are steel and the the squeegees on the wet attatchment are nice and sturdy. The favorite attachment of mine is the big floor tool. This thing can be used through-out the entire house. It has a foot switch to raise and lower the brushes for carpet or bare floors. The reason I only went 4 stars is because the tools are good enough .
1,The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way reading the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
1,"Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! The singer voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting airy. Perfection!"
1,Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (high shcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
1,"Old fashioned, sweet story.: Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it."
1,"Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail.Children is fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start."
1,"Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception, but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would of gave it a 5 if I had not read the others."
1,"Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of ""playing with future"" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us."
1,"This book takes a typical family, examines its separate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has. I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together."
1,"So much better than the apple version!: I love it, it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot! It's wonderful!"
1,"Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!. Get this. You'll not regret it."
1,"Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended."
1,"A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like.. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered."
1,"Quite Satisfactory: This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. But once again, that’s a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase."
1,Classic: Watched this for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!
1,"This is a good product!: When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord breakdown. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!"
1,Thomas connector tracks: A The Thomas wooden track connector piece is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson would end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
1,"My Girl Likes It: My two and half years old girl likes it so much, and every time I want  to allure her to bed,  I say to her I will read ""I Spy in bed""."
1,"excellent: Good price, excellent design and shipped well. Would’ve been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving."
1,"Easy as it can be.: I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all, but she had no trouble with setting this up. She's completely happy, California is happy, and I'm happy."
1,"Absolutely great tripod for movie camera: excellent and cheap.and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of ""shaky"" movement....stable...tall...worth the price"
1,"Best witch book I’ve ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read. I recommended this book to ALL my friends, and I recommend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
1,"A written masterpiece: I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible, this book is a masterpiece unparalleled."
1,"Big things in small package: When I purchased this small hardcover book, I didn't expect very much. I was pleasant when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.It is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship."
1,"This will interest children in insects: This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout, with many beautiful photographs. The text, mixed nicely with the pictures, covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts."
1,"Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Watch this film because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles."
1,"Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh, so has a good stopper to it."
1,fireplace tool set: Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
1,"reliable service: the item came in time, the second faucet that I order from them was missing a piece. I contacted them and got a quick response. the missing part was sent right away."
1,"Long Hot Summer: two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia."
1,"One of my favorites as a kid: I loved this book when I was about eight years old, and looking back on it, it's easy to see why: William, the main character, is a gymnast (just as I was) who's rather shy and reserved (just as I was), when it's important, to help the people around him. He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid. this is a strong book for both children and for adults"
1,This is a great book for beginners!: I loved the recipes and nutritional information. There is even a list of manufacturers in the back of the book.
1,"Great table: This table is easy to put together and just what we were looking for. Comes with all hardware -- just add the wood of your choosing. Note that the instructions are printed on the box (no paper instructions inside), so don't rip up or throw away the box before you read the instructions. Good product. It's been a little over 5 years since I bought this and this table and benches are still working beautifully, with some sanding and painting of the wood. Definitely a good value."
1,"Excellent: My daughter loves this series then got me hooked, too. Shocking, Funny, Intriguing, and romantic. Great music, too, which is always a plus., I think you'll like it.."
1,Beautiful harmony!: What a blessing to have this CD available. I bought several for gifts. The harmony and blending of voices is wonderful. It does my heart good. Thank you!
1,"Very awesome product: Love how soft this makes the skin, it is sticky but then just absorbs nicely into skin. I use regularly."
1,Satisfaction: Enjoy a cup of this each morning. I especially appreciate that Folgers Cappuccino does not have a strong acid aftertaste. I will continue to purchase but wish the price was a bit lower.
1,"Superior performance: These table tennis balls are great. As soon as I tried them you could feel the difference with other brands. It has a nice bounce and last long, and I mean long. Butterfly 3-star balls are perfect for recreational play as well as for competitive play so if you're a beginner this is what you want to use or if you are a higher level player (intermediate to expert) these balls will get the job done. These balls are worth every cent you spend. It will be the official ball for the 2009 World Championships for one reason; they're superb!"
1,Excellent!: Great flavor and texture. Can be frozen after baked. Good price. Very happy with the product. Worth a try!
1,Great toy: My daughter loves this toy. She plays with it all the time. At first you think it's not really sturdy but she had no problem standing up with it.
1,Awesome: These are the greatest things in the world. At the prices on Amazon you can't loose. Definatly a good buy.
1,Simple product for remembering: Well made bag and labeled for easily finding your wheel locks. Leave the bag in your glove box tool for easy finding .
1,fun!: These shoes are sexy and comfortable. I got them right on time and they were even hotter in person. I think they make legs and feet look better than other HIGH HIGH heels I have bought before.
1,Overall good phone: I've had this phone for about a year now. As a phone its pretty good as far as voice quality and reception. It fits well in the palm of the hand and in pocket. The keyboard is very handy for entering info into the phonebook. The Camera also takes good pictures.My phone did have an issue with charging and retaining charge of the battery. I took it to a local T-Mobile store and they filled out a warranty form to get it exchanged and received a replacement in 4 days. So far no problems with the replacement phone.Overall functions very well as a phone and is very stylish. Just watch out for potential issue with charging and retaining charge
1,"Love: We love this puzzle! It's way cute! The colors are so vibrant and I love the large block style puzzle pieces, they are much more durable!"
1,PAINTS PICTURES: Great artwork and very creative production. Check out the video which is on the CD. As good as his other albums and has created his own niche. Would like to hear more of the  vocalist  vocal ability. Otherwise delighted with this imaginative piece of work.
1,Exactly what I needed: I got exactly what I wanted out of this product. I have had no problems and no complaints. I like that it came with an extra watch strap and battery. Overall no problems.
1,good buy: I had a surprisingly tough time finding this  BASIC case. Grab this one while you can. Constructed pretty well and seems like it will last.
1,Perfect replacement: This is exactly what I needed. It is faster than the old one was when it was new so I give it points for that.
1,"Good enough case but...: If you have a relatively inexpensive racket, then this case will do. It has a padded inside, but no strap to hold your racket in place. This is important because if your racket moves around a lot inside, the edges of the rubber can become damaged. If you have an expensive racket, I recommend you get a hard case."
1,"Wonderful Step-by-Step photo directions: Along with the great gardening plans and in depth directory of vegetables giving soil requirements, sowing, harvesting, storage, pests, diseases and varieties best suited for your location, each vegetable has 5 or 6 pictures. The recipes are divided by season and the photos were very easy to follow in order to create very fancy dishes in a very simple manner I have given this book to several friends ."
1,"Getting better: The books are getting better, adding more details about the horses and stuff like that. I really hope that some more drastic changes happen soon in the next few books. This book was definitely better than the few before it. READ!"
1,"Creative Writing Exemplified: This is a very funny book. I use it in my classroom of middle schoolers. As an English teacher, I use this book in my classroom to illustrate ""creative thinking"". We had so much fun writing similar rules."
1,"Love it!: Clear, crisp images, used in bright sunlight it makes the color saturation and contrast so much more visible. Can't live without this one in sunny Florida, especially when waterside anthropomorphic are being photographed. Reduces glare, restores back lighting to a natural color."
1,"Good Steam Cleaner: Purchased this product to clean original ceramic tile in my 55 year old home. I used it on the kitchen counter, floor and bathroom tile on the wall and counter. I am pleased with the performance of the machine. The little brushes included with the package work well on the grout. This machine gets surfaces clean and does not require chemicals to do it."
1,Fantastic: I really enjoyed this book. it worths  5 stars from me.
1,"Great book, very useful for teachers!: This is a very practical book full of history and information that is very helpful for classroom teaching. I teach 6th grade and found the diagrams and projects interesting and helpful in building an understanding of the "

1,"Excellent book: If you are an animal lover and/or have an interest in the struggles of vet school buy this book. It's a good read, lots of details, and has some good stories."
1,"Nice stand: This stand is just like what you see in the photos and video. I am very impressed with the quality. The tubing is thick enough that even if the padding on the handle sections were to wear out, the handles would still be comfortable. Assembling it was a piece of cake. The item was securely packed so that it survived the shipping process in perfect shape. When I use it, it is completely stable on my carpeted floor.."
1,"Good workout music: This CD is good for working out. I like all the songs and it is very easy to get into it. Some of the songs are unfamiliar, but with the upbeat music it doesn't matter."
1,5 stars: I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. It is amazing! I have watched it several times already.
1,"Great cookbook!: Very simple, yet delicious recipes. Exactly what you would expect from Mr. Food. We're excited to make many of these dishes!"
1,Love it: Great book! I think every Mom should read it! It makes you realize that you shouldn't take yourself too seriously and just have fun with your kiddos!
1,"A lot of fun plus great messages: This book has many great messages - Let go and try to enjoy your kids a little, Motherhood doesn't always have to be so hard, and it's not a competition. While I disagreed with the author on some areas (like junk food and toy choices), there's a lot of enjoyment and confidence to be gained here."
1,"Awesome Watch!: The Seiko SNP007 is well worth the money. Looks very sharp, and keeps excellent time. I have had mine for about a month, and am very satisfied with it!"
1,"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BOOK!!!: I was given this book as a gift for the holidays. I was immediately impressed with the photos, which made my mouth water. Chef recipes make me want to eat more often. This book will make a terrific gift or a perfect way to treat yourself if you enjoy food."
1,"Good: Class required book. this book is really Good, but I find it difficult to understand a few problems in it."
1,"Perfect! Except...: I'll tell you, this controller works great for COD, TF2, Garry's Mod, both PC and XBOX gaming. But the only problem, with older games"
1,So helpful!: I was so confused about what to do about feeding my 5 month old. Too early for solids? She seemed ready. Was I feeding her so much? She was getting so big so fast. This book made me calm down a great deal and listen to what my daughter was saying. We're both much happier now. I wish I'd had it from the beginning because it looks to have some great information on breastfeeding that would have really helped me out.
1,"Best way to get rid of ear wax!!: I believe this ear wax product is the best on the market. You can not find a better product for a better price. I use it all the time, it is amazing. I would highly recommend it to anyone with dirty ears."
1,"Eye-popping illusions!: This is an amazing collection of illusions! I am a vision scientist and have seen quite a lot of visual illusions, but this book contains new illusions that I've never seen before. Fascinating! This collection features the latest in contemporary visual illusions as well as novel twists on classic visual illusions. The color graphics are beautiful, and the illusions are compelling on both a scientific and aesthetic level."
1,Easy to use but: Its easy to use but if you get Another brand it will have different controls than this one.
1,"Excellent book but not quite what i thought it would be: this book although extremely informative and easy to understand, describes techniques using a lot of specialist equipment which is no good to anyone without them"
1,Excellent Juicer: This is a great juicer and does a great job of extracting the juice even from whole fruits.
1,A Wonderful CD!: Addictive! An album that is truly worth buying - FANTASTIC collection of songs. vocalist is so  fabulous.
0,Weak graphics represent a 10-year-old decline in graphics quality. Suitable for a 10-year-old computer but not for modern computers today. The game is fine if you want to play blackjack but it is old in the graphic display.
0,"Incorrect item: I requested one  item  and received another. This was required to study an online course, and because of the error, I am behind schedule in my classroom work."
0,"Not useful and waste of money: the program does not meet the required purpose, it is a waste of money. The questions on the demo CD are misleading ... they do not reflect the style of the questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!"
0,"It doesn't work: We plan to have some family fun by playing a game ""Dice."" Our only pleasure was in how it didn't work at all."
0,"Bad company: the scanner looks nice but very tricky, i bought this scanner because of the name xerox, i owned it for about 2 months and now it died! And they say I will get one again. (Bad company)"
0,I will not buy again from these other air mattresses: This is the third rank in 5 or 6 weeks and they all have the same problem. They all leak air. I am very grateful for Amazon's great return policy. It was a pleasure to deal with them.
0,"Don't buy this camera: It's a very nice camera for its compact design, however the speaker is very close to the tape drive. During the quiet and quiet areas, you will hear a loud beep sound coming from the camera as well as what you are recording. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. I was really disappointed, I wish there was a way to fix it."
0,"Safety pins: These pins do not penetrate the fabric well at all, so it was not helpful to me. I threw it in the trash"
0,"What a complete waste of time and money: This movie is really stinky. The acting is terrible, the action (action) is too much and the comedy is very stupid."
0,"The tongue hurts: the shoe looked nice. Unfortunately, the upper part of the tongue hurts my ankle when I tighten the shoe. It does not matter which sock I wore. I had to return it."
0,"Do I miss something?: Sorry for rating it one star - not for book content (I can't read it), but for the awful way it is being displayed on my iPad. The cover page is nice and big, fills the screen, and looks great. However, the subsequent page is about half the size, which means that two pages fit across the iPad screen, and the font is too small to be read, furthermore, the iPad version only allows landscape width"
0,"Tough going: You stumbled a lot with the multiple characters, places, and time periods in this book. Not a good book to pick up from time to time, as it requires focused reading. It is only one book in the series!"
0,"The worst movie ever: Go open the red light camera and steal the movie. That would be 10,000,000 times better acting and plot than watching this movie"
0,"Stay away: that's bad¡  Boring ..... I couldn't find anything less fun and interesting than this. It is a waste of time."
0,"Product Quality and Support Disappointment: After returning the first release of these printers due to a continuous paper jam, the replacement printer did not recognize or allow me to replace the first printer driver. In an attempt to overcome this problem by contacting customer service, I get a recorded audio message stating that I will be referred to the professionals, but to no avail, the replacement printer has also been returned."
0,"Its a cable: Its a cable, it works, what else do you want? I know its not the cheapest one out there, but what is written on it is  :  ""sony"". But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for. Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products."
0,awesome book to explain death to children: The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
0,"Not What I'd Hoped For: I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises hick UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men in black behaving badly. With little to recommend it and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings¡ The Mothman Prophecies"" is a considerable disappointment."
0,"SHAME ON YOU Dear author!!!: Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the crap hole. Were led to believe that the author  is a sensible, unbiased investigator, when really he's a paranoid. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead."
0,"And the point was...?: Although I prefer books with an actual plot, I don't mind reading choppy, journal-type entries if there is actually a point to all of it, or if at least such entries are entertaining.. After a while you'll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that's just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn't worth the time--or the title. There's hardly anything about ""the moth man"" in it."
0,"Mothman prophecies?: 257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70's UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else."
0,"Never Before.......: Have I quit reading a book. I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this, oh man was I disappointed. I thought  this book would be an intelligent well written piece on the mothman mystery. I don't know what this was. I’ve never seen such bad writing. I had absolutely no clue was going on in this book. Just crazy!"
0,"What's the big deal?: The only thing interesting about this album is Vocalist accent . Seriously, the beats her singing are tired and clich. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music."
0,"I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time."
0,"Repetitive and monotone: I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."
0,"When I first heard about this book I wondered if its content is new or a continuation of previous content. Fortunately, a continuation.I had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in stock, I bought it. I read it in 4 days, reading each night after work. I can say it was a good read. Streamlined work, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc.I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt."
0,"Fine until it started eating tapes: Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous ""Remove cassette"" message and is mangling tapes. I have used this camera  to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for ""canon zr users group"" and ""eating tapes"" to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders."
0,"Don't repeat that .. don't take this camcorder .. nothing worse than wasting money and buying it from amazon.com. Could have got the same, maybe just a little less with 4 DVD, and a carrying case. It's frankly the worst electronic, disgusting, and vile product. If you bought it you would literally throw your money in the Atlantic Ocean do not get this even if someone pays for it. Bring it back. Get your money back !!!!!!!"
0,It has to be !: I'm not one of those writing ratings. Only in this I wrote an evaluation because it contains music. Dancing with valentines ... wonderful! Loss if you don't take this cd
0,The disc is intact but the case is in terrible condition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.
0,"Expensive experiment that didn't work: I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing."
0,"I find that the moves were  at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous.. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised."
0,"Small type: My review centers on only one thing - the size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe that the quthor  meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose."
0,"Can I shoot myself now??: A few years back I was forced to read ""Tess"" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.  This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, , read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers . do NOT waste your time and money on this book ."
0,Awful: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.
0,Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for Virtuous Woman to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
0,"I hated this book....: ...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read this book  as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that's done."
0,"Bad purchace.: Well I thought I was getting the student edition, but I got the Instructor's edition. I guess I'll have to go back to B&N."
0,I have been using this for several months and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin.
0,"novel  of The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing But I was sorely disappointed. please read this novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that the author  was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
0,"Sad Yet Beautiful: The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film, but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine, who believes in emotional and physical fidelity For whom she love, and cannot change her feelings. This film explores the difference between the two, and the pain that one causes the other by his ""lightness of being"".Towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker, so be ready to cry your eyes out."
0,"A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book, too. Not for the shallow-minded."
0,Lacking: The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
0,"The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite .Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident."
0,"disappointed: I have been very impressed by  this music. This music  did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style, it was a great disappointment, and this is one CD I will get rid of quickly."
0,"Yeah:, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one. Came quickly, shipped well, no problems...except the film itself...just....bad."
0,"Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP!: This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan .stay away from this movie."
0,"Wrongly labeling movies as 3D: I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection."
0,"Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy?: Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy."
0,Horrible: Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time.
0,"The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.: The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck."
0,"Not as advertised: Very poor quality. Neither of the batteries held a charge, even with extended time on the base. Basically don't waster your money."
0,"The Download does not install!: I have a new computer that fit the specifications for this game, but after it finishes downloading it does not install properly."
0,"Seemed like a great deal - until the hardware failed: I was excited to get this product, especially with the rebate. It installed easily, and worked, for about 12 hours. I called tech support and we determined my router was dead.. It took more than 6 phone calls.the router was replaced , worked well, (the wireless had issues)The new router died the same way the next morning.  I have to buy products from another company."
0,"Slow and tedious characters ...: I had a very difficult time finishing this novel, although I did. It was very boring but my main problem is I did not care for any of the characters."
0,"Not a page turner by any means: After reading some of the reviews about this book , I was excited to read it ....what a huge dissapointment. It was boring The book was tedious to read. I was hoping it would get better the more I read but it actually got worse."
0,"Seller in UK - buyer beware!: I still have not received this book! I ordered it over a month ago and it is still not here. If I could rate this seller with ZERO STARS, I would. The seller is in the UK and has had extreme difficulty sending my product on time. I have emailed and keep hearing ""It's on it's way""."
0,"Bad Bad Bad: This was one of the worst films I have ever watched. This was due to the acting. The ships, costume and the rest were good, but could not make up for the slow ponderous storyline and slow ponderous dialogue."
0,"covers a lot of important things, just left out building web sites: this book covers topics like control software and network architecture. I was hoping this book would cover some examples of software architecture and how/why it's scalable..I feel a little cheated to be honest"
0,"TERRIBLE glue! Cheap stuff worls 10x better than this!: This glue was terrible. It was Adulterated and did NOT hold. It was not a a penny! I have bought numerous glues, and this is by far the worst and the most expensive! Hate this product!"
0,"Fortunately, common sense led me to think even before thinking about buying these atrocities. I listened to previous opinions. I think the mothers have taken revenge after all."
0,"Sounds more techno than spiritual: I listened to the samples at before I got this cd, but it sounds much different than I expected. It's like a combo of native sounds with techno. It's not bad, but I plan to resell."
0,Insufficient glue on DVD: entire movie cannot be viewed. (The clear plastic on one of the DVD interfaces is separated from the delicate glossy disc on the other side in some areas of the DVD. Therefore the player could not read it. Buy again from elsewhere.
0,"Not so happy feet: There isnt much to say about this movie. It's as bad as bad could be. The story is bad, the songs are horrible...if you would like it, it's because of it's enormous crap-factor. An unhappy smile :( for the unhappy feet"
0,I can't believe I paid the money to go see this! waste of time. Do not expose your children to this. Their IQ will decrease: I went to see this in the middle of the day. Children did not finish watching. They got out of the stage. It was really bad.
0,This movie is absolutely terrible: I may have done permanent damage to my child's cognitive development by letting him watch it. crap designed to steal your money.
0,Don't buy this movie: it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Spend your money on useful things but not on this.
0,Terrifying: terrifying children ... it was horrific ... even children hated it. Do not waste your money. Painful when watching it !! It would have been better to spend the day watching ducks in a pond and then watching this movie.
0,"It is nothing like the first: First was amazing, this was created just to try and take your money. Was horrible! Go watch the first one, leave this one alone!"
0,happy feet 2: Thought I was ordering a dvd and what I received was a download. A rip off. Tried to cancell because the download would be of no use .
0,Don't waste your time: this movie is not good for kids. It is the sequel to a movie full of bad. Why take a risk?
0,"Not fun: Really this movie is not fun. What is the intended purpose? Is he considered that children are stupid, ignorant and deserve unconscious support?"
0,"The kids din't like it at all.: Barely any content, cheap exploitation of the brand in expectation kids and parent will swallow the product. big brands to get to your kids too.I had trouble looking at the whole thing. Soon to be in garbage bin all around the world."
0,Very disappointed: completely disappointing ... I expected more from this movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone !! Do not buy it. The movie is not good!
0,"Embarrassing, note to the studios and powers that funded this piece of garbage: find another job that has nothing to do with animation, animals, music, or the entertainment industry. To anyone else: Don't watch, pay for, or even think about this movie."
0,"Terrible thing: I don't know the reason, but I want my money to get back this handicapped movie, it's just a plunder movie just made out of making more money in their spacious pockets."
0,NO...JUST NO!: I would rather of used my money to buy a knife to stab myself in the heart with than watch this movie. Yes it was that bad. Babies will cry because it was that bad
0,"Both: It is not worth anyone's time. It is better to look at vomiting on the street. Seriously, do not watch or give your money to these people!"
0,"Happy feet are not so happy: I saw this animated clown through a CD in the store. As far as I can see it is a weak attempt to re-try old-fashioned ideas and characters from the first movie, save yourself some money and skip this."

0,"So cute: My son loves it. My complaint is that it lasted about 8 months. I thought the battery died, but the whole engine did. Once dead, it's pretty useless because you can't push it on the tracks.Just bought a replacement."
0,Cold Coffee: I bought this coffee maker and I regret it. This machine is heavy and awkward and the coffee is cold. Buyer Beware
0,"Cheap and useless: I have this broom for less than a year. It can't handle anything larger than sand, it smells of burning rubber, and as for the design, the power button is in an inconvenient place. I should have brought her back right away."
0,No charger came with it: This item didn't ship with a charger.. Ended up having to spend an extra 40 for a new charger....Im sure the product works great but buying it from amazon was a waste...
0,"Defective product : Audio 1/4"" to 1/8"" Stereo Adapter does not work. It's a waste of $4. . I will not buy anything from this mall again."
0,"Incoherent, Misquoting, incomprehensible literature!: Many sentences are incomplete, and the author misquotes scripture. The majority of this book are quotes, assumptions, and fiction. He support the majority of minor issues and does not provide evidential support for his own opinions so the reader has no idea how he came up with them."
0,"I have two of  Roomba brooms. Our Rumba is used twice daily. Although it cleans well, I had a lot of problems keeping it working in the drive despite cleaning it, cleaning the brushes and spreading them with air after each use. The process people became boring. I can only conclude that the long-term tolerance is, at best, questionable and that the maintenance of this type of vacuum cleaner is much greater than that of regular vacuum cleaners."
0,I bought 4 roomba vacuum cleaners in 3 months. The first worked for 10 hours. And the last for two hours. I will get it back and get my money back.
0,"Don't buy this product !: I bought this cleaner a year ago for use in my office ... stuck to the carpet is a terrible product. I was going to return it to the manufacturer but I found out that they were working to resell the product, so I canceled the idea. I made many purchases over the years. This is the worst product I have ever purchased.. do not buy!"
0,"Quality as always: I always go with fiber optic cables, given their quality, I am not very proud of their name because they triple the price."

0,"Get some new ideas: come up with some new movie ideas! If not, the movies will become abhorrent and hateful!"
0,"Bad purchase: We bought this inflatable mattress, but it shrank after inflatable. We tried again. The same end, we tried to find the leak with soap and water. Finally we asked for a new valve for the mattress to swell, shrinking again even with the new valve. We are not satisfied with this purchase."
0,Air leakage - unusable: You have inflated this mattress. A large amount of air leaked within one hour. Do not buy this.
0,"Battery-powered pump is not working: I see some bad reviews about this product, but I find it interesting that no one has complained about the fact that the battery-powered air pump is a complete garbage. . I admit that the mattress looks really pretty, and you may feel comfortable sleeping after it's completely inflated, but what's good about that if the pump isn't working? To make matters worse, I tried to put the damned thing inside the box to get it back, but the damned thing doesn't even get inside! While you're inside the box, there's no space to put the pump in, and the box looks like it's about to explode. This product is not worth getting it."
0,I paid for this product but never received it - beware !!!!: I placed my order in a month ago and am still waiting for it to arrive.
0,"don't waste your money: Do not waste your money buying this item. I tested it on various glass surfaces and it did not perform well, it didn't even puncture skin."
0,It does not work: How can it save life if it does not work? it is a gift. I am very disappointed about this product.
1,"Good grill for the money.: I've been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I've used it to grill steaks, duck breasts, veggies, and chicken. Takes longer than a gas grill, but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen."
1,"Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray]: This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!"
1,Awesome: This movie was awesome! The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.
1,"I am so glad I found this!: At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found ""Quaker Oat Bran"" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and keeps its crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too."
1,"Excellent.....REALLY: Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I'd just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up. EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT."
1,"I'm grateful for this book: We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book Illustrates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime, which I found slightly surprising."
1,"Effective book for discussing physical death with a child: As a public school librarian, I would say that ""Lifetimes"" is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death. The text states: ""Nothing that is alive goes on living forever."" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that ""Lifetimes"" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system."
1,Great band even better now: Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music. When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice. These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare. The music is angry and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.
1,"Impressive: One of the few CDs of this type of music music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring. This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. Professionally done and melodic. Many of my friends also enjoy listening to this CD."
1,The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity: This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after a while with this book...
1,"Good for after work cruising, better for airplane tranquility: Listening to this cd, I turned on  my car stereo all the way up, on my way back from work. . The words of the song contain great pride, and the beats are wonderful. 10 dollars and Hombre are two of my favorite tracks, they are both clever yet funny. It's actually very good stuff when you are on a plane, totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat, and you can imagine a party in your head."
1,"So Original, So Fun: A friend introduced this CD to me and it's quickly become a favorite. The music so catchy and so fun, yet it's also lasting...I've been listening to it over and over. And I love it. It brings a positive  vibe into her music."
1,"Old age gold...: As a 72 year old man from the UK, I was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time (which was quite frankly, before my time). I love it and hope you do too.Thanks, OC."
1,"Lots of effects, lightweight and easy to use: the amazing camera functions in this camcorder This easy-to-use image weight makes it easy to shoot great memories for a beginner like me, just by taking them out of the box. This camcorder also has a large collection of special effects, and options for using really interesting video effects. I love this camera!"
1,"An excellent book for novice educators:  the author  does a great job of making book formatting simple but interesting. His explanation of games with goals, group size, time, process and changes for each game is very useful. It's written so the sales team leader can pick it up and has some great games to make his / her team think creatively, work in teamwork and self-confidence. My only complaint as a former performer and current coach is that it is not long enough. Type another."
1,"hard -to-find tension rods: Our living room has a ""bow"" window with five narrow panels. I looked many places for narrow-but-strong tension rods. I was pleased to find these and to get free shipping. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you."
1,"YES, YES, YES great read: Love the book..I was born 250 years too late..I would have liked to been there at the time...HOWEVER,  the play  does not sound like it feels good ! lol"
1,"Paradise kiss rocks!!!!: OMG!! That is all I can say. It is so cool !!! When I heard about it for the first time I was hesitating, should I read it or not? After that I decided, ""Why not?"" Now that you've read this cool manga, there is no going back !!! Strongly recommend !!!!"
1,"Love these glasses: I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I. Anyway, I really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier. Also, these glasses are very stable, don't tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don't slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these."
1,"a well awarded but oft forgotten classic: I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of one of the  families  are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more ""Adventure! Action!"" type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!"
1,"Best book  for this author !: I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen, and it had me hooked on it .the author  has let me down time and time again since, but this book is a classic.  You MUST read this one. It'll be fun, and you won't be able to put it down."
1,Good Piece: I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s)  used by the author  throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
1,"Beautifully written, dark Masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl.: A beautifully written, dark masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl.

She meets a man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story. It's a beautiful love story, and so much more. Highly recommended!"
1,"Science Fact Empowers Science Fiction: Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the ""manned mission to Mars"" genre."
1,"Short stories with a message: Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples' private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life, something drastic can happen and change your world around. The stories are touching, yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of life.I would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life."
1,"Fantastic products - great way to try them all!: I try everything new, hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes (and I'm only 36!) --Anyway, when I read about rice bran, I thought why not - this brand contains a lot of rice bran - it's like the 2nd ingredient in everything after water. The stuff smells great, and goes on non-greasy, especially the face cream it's like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in."
1,"Amazingly soft hair!: I have been looking for an all natural shampoo, and this is a wonderful one. It made my hair incredibly soft .I was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair. The sample is worth the price just to test it out."
1,"Prose-Poetry to inspire: I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (this author  is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down."
1,Life changing!: This book has changed my life. I want to buy copies to my friends.
1,transformers: The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker than the other movies.  There is  some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
1,Loved It!: I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!

1,great game !!!: it's pretty old school game but still can have a fun time with this game.shipping was pretty fast too !!!
1,"This game was pretty cheap! But the only thing is that the game it self , is pretty boring. So I dont really play it. But its cool the download!!"
1,EXCELLENT BOOK: I read this book on my own first and then read it with my husband. It helped us tremendously and I plan to read it on a yearly bases every year. It's one of those books you don't regret buying and will keep in your collection for years to come and maybe even hand down to your children in hopes that it will help them as much as it has helped you. This book HELPED us to find peace and hold onto it.I highly recommend this book for ALL people. We all need peace and this book will help you to figure out how to tap into what God has already given you.

1,"Yoga Tape!:. They have sussed out exactly what people in our life and times need, and have given us fun and exciting ways to fill that need. This is a whole body workout which delves deep and turns your exercise time into a life changing experience. Each time I do this I feel lighter and better about myself. I also feel stronger, more relaxed, and more focused and inspired!"
1,"After a fast start:, entertainment represents about 7 percent of our economy. This makes it a worthy topic for analysis.  The author  gets off to a good start in the early chapters, telling us how entertainment became so pervasive a component of work and education, as well as our leisure. We see the sociological and technical reasons. We are informed about the vast increase in entertainment media of all types, and how this competes for our attention. This is why only the best gets noticed.anyone who keeps up with business and technology news from the popular press will learn little from the rest of the book."
1,"Entertaining, perhaps, infromative - no: I really wanted this book to have definitive, hard hitting infromation on the real impact of entertainment on the economy, business models and culture. Unfortunately, the only message was we are spending more time and money then ever before on entertainment. It shouldn't have taken 300 pages to repeat this message."
1,"Beautiful!: This recording contains come of the most beautiful harmonies I have ever heard. clear and thoughtfully produced .The songs are traditonal - some familiar, some not so, a delightful combination. Behind these recordings there is a distinct love of the music; some are joyful, some heartbreaking. You will not be disappointed by this record, and you are guaranteed to run the full gamut of emotions while listening."
1,"This book is really good: This book is really good for anyone who loves imagination. Slagger takes some naive people hostage to being used as slaves, but Matthews comes to save them. Matthews and his friends must use logic and temporary thinking on the hostages. But they face problems along the way. They meet more characters who help and harm them. So I would recommend this series to anyone with a slight interest in fiction, because it really is fictional."
1,"Thrilling to the core!!!!: This author  is a execellent author and demonstrates that through this book. It has a strong message about the strength and spirit of children. he always spend time stressing the fact that the ""adults"" do not want them to go on any adventure. It also has that wonderful bond of parent and child love."
1,"top notch: Thouroughly original, highly intellectual, and finally deeply moving -- an account of the persistent odd role of adversity in literary creation."
1,"nicely made, colorful: i bought this as a gift for a 1 yo baby boy. it seems great as a sorting toy, but not as a pulling toy since the pieces just sit loosely on top of each other and fall apart easily. very nice wooden construction ."
1,"Old, but Goodie: Read this years ago and loved it. It's a fast and fun read. Happy with it."
1,"Musician , your music is enchanting.....: Upon listening, my heart & soul are easily whisked away from the matrix of life to a buoyant feeling of open skies, beautiful mountains,... and finding rest in the shelter of trees. Thank you for creating this wonderful mini-escape."
1,"Buy it: This is the best movie in the world. I've watched it a hundred times, and I'm still crying. It's a mixture of movement and emotion, and I recommend it to everyone."
1,"A science fiction thought at its best ... I first read this book when I was twelve years old, and it changed many of my beliefs. It is about perception, and how to filter our thoughts through what we are experiencing. Consequently, it creates missed opportunities to process truly new information. I recommend this work based on the strength of what I came up with. It's simple with story level, well written and easy to read."
1,He couldn't catch my attention at all. The movie looks as though something will happen pretty much all the time. But nothing happens.
1,This 3D movie !!!: I hate 3D movies. The first was good but not good.
1,"Honestly I cannot understand why that singer didn't win with this song, its outrageous!!!!!! This song is classy and emotional."
1,GREAT MAX BOOK..: I THINK THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE SOURCE FOR ANYONE WANTING TO GET EVERYTHING THEY CAN FROM THE LATEST VERSION OF MAX. I LOVED THE PRACTICE FILES IN THE CD ALSO..
1,"This is a game from our two-year-old daughter to her six-month-old sister. The little daughter plays with it , pulling it around the house wherever she goes. She feels happy whenever she sees it, and gets angry if she tries to take her away from her. Our house is still in perfect condition after two years of play."
1,great: I recieved this within 3 business days. The price was great. It is in great condition. I could not wait for them to come any faster.
1,"good case: This is a good case for my new Sony camera, though the value for money aspect kept me from giving it a perfect score of five stars.The fit for the camera is snug, and protect it .. It also resists scratches -- I've used mine for several weeks and have already traveled with it a great deal, and it still looks new ."
1,"Best product in its category.: Out of all of the whitening products I have tried, this product is the most user friendly. Nearly all of the ""strips"" on the market have the same levels of peroxide for whitening; the true product differentiatior is the usability of the product. This product conforms to teeth very securely, covers all areas, and does not loose its adhesiveness after 1.5 hours (as long as I have tested)."
1,"love it: Great educational video for preschool - first grade students. My son is currently in kindergarten and he just love these videos, which as helped him in his spelling words for school"
1,"Too much Humanities: It focus too much in Humanities and its skills. It basically translates academia skills into teaching, and talk too much how useful teaching can be in other jobs. In science there is research without teaching, and there are probably  other skills that can be useful in non-academic jobs it gives some ""tools"" how to break your own research activities into more detailed ""actions"", but still does not tell me which ones are interesting in non-academic jobs."
1,Little preparation required: Rumba Proma cleans much better than you expect. it picks up a lot of things and works really well to hide things under the sofas. Requires more preparation for use. The only negative is that it requires more preparation for use. You have to pick everything up from the room first.
1,Classic TV: I grew up watching Perry Mason and now can share them with my own children. The first reaction is a groan but within ten minuetes everyone is gluded to the show and with no sugestive ads that I have to explain.
1,"One of the best new bands I've heard in a long time: how I describe their sound.). This is the first band I've heard since then that has a very fresh sound. The first I heard a song, I downloaded a few more and then bought the CD. Listening to the songs, I truly feel like the band is having fun making good music, not copying other bands and trying to make a million bucks. I listen to this CD over and over again."
1,"Your baby will love this!: I received one of these blankets as a gift from my mother. It is SOOO soft.! My son stays so warm and loves the feel of it so much we had to go out and buy more of them, as he prefers them over his other blankets. Definitely a great investment!"
1,"Disappointment: I really wanted to love this movie. I know it's a low budget product. The acting is poor and the scenario is worse. All clothes look fresh and clean, making them look like a school play. With a little better orientation and some different actors, this could be very good. Do not expect much and you will not be very disappointed."
1,"The production quality of this movie is very poor as well as the acting. The acting is so horrible that it distracts you from the story. Really low budget. If you compare the production of other films to it, this is very bad. it is a pity ."
1,Big swing: The swing chair is really cool. The only problem we have is that the whole chair is firmly seated on the base. The belt system is a little complicated but it carries the child safely on the chair.
1,"Awesome book to read!: I just finished this book. The new author has his own style and goes to a new level of exploring gender issues. This author explores the relationship between religion, homosexuality, friendship and marriage between the sexes. The book is based on real things. . Get your copy today!"
1,"My wife loves Rumba broomRobot, we consider Rumba a member of our family. My wife loves her. Rumba works very well with wood floors. It does not work well with thick carpets, especially with good quality oriental rugs. Rumba broom has some difficulties moving from the floor to the rug if the rug is too thick."
1,"Good product: I ordered a copy of this improved product a while ago, but when I received it it was broken. I asked for a new one and I am happy with it."
1,My daughter wanted this set of toys. We bought it and it was of high quality. Not disappointing at all. I would recommend anyone to this manufacturer.
1,"Excellent, real cleaning and best performance compared to its price: we are 100% satisfied with our decision to purchase a Bissell vacuum cleaner for its cleaning and suction performance. Easy to operate, relatively low noise, best price, and beautiful appearance."
1,"A very happy customer: a person with a heavy vacuum cleaner can make multiple presence at the same time. But a person who has a heavy vacuum cleaner will not sweep my apartment every day for an hour. Rumba vacuum cleaner will do this, and the result is that the floor is cleaner. I allow her every morning while I get ready to work and I have no problems with it .."
1,"best gummi peaches ever: i love candy, and i love haribo, these gummi peaches give me a sense of nostalgia and are easily my favorite...i highly recommend these..."

1,"High quality product: I use this mattress for camping. For the price, it is irresistible. I weighed 215 pounds, and I didn't lose any air in the mattress for the first two days, a little bit on the third day. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this over its competitors."
1,"Perfect for what we need: We ordered two of these airbags. I gave it four stars because the second one had a leak, I prepared it (very easy operation) and received a replacement (without leaks!) Quickly. Easy to inflate and empty, I think this product is worth the money!"
1,"Great product. I installed the antenna everywhere possible in my Tahoe, and it worked regardless of where it was. Great, easy-to-use program that gives you real-time accident reports (depending on your location). I would recommend this hardware suite for anyone who wants GPS solutions for their car."
1,"Hope you own a battery shop: This is a really great radio, but it consumes batteries and has no charger. Stay away from this product."
1,Good value: the device is good but batteries tend to lose a lot of energy quickly. A small handy unit.
1,Great invention: It is a versatile (all-in-one) glass breaker and seat belt cutter in case the car breaks down. One got for me and one for my mom.
1,"Lack of service / support: this vacuum cleaner worked great for the first few weeks, good cleaning, very quiet and unobtrusive. Then the problems started. The company sent a replacement for free but that didn't solve the problem."
1,"For the price, it's great. The fact that the latch is not very reliable, especially with my 200lbs weight. Though it is good for my uses."
1,"Movie and excellent seller: I saw this movie when it first appeared, and it was beautiful. I am very happy to have it on DVD. Some may find it slow in some ways, but I loved it. . A great epic movie. The seller was very fast and made the purchase seem like I was buying from a friend."
1,I love this book: I read this book completely from start to finish in one day. It was great. Full of useful information.

1,"Works well: the air mattress inflates in seconds. It is comfortable. Difficult to wrap and fold it, but everything was worth the money."
1,"Great book !!!!: With all the bad comments, you might think this book is not good but not so !!! I love fear books and this is the best !!! !!! I loved this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wonderful: Really amazing CD !!! This is the first time that I bought this artist CD and became an instant fan.

1,Great baseball game !!!: It is a great baseball game !!! . It was a lot of fun. I will give it a maximum of five stars.
1,Powerful wet steam device: I bought this device on the recommendation of my pest control official as we are currently dealing with bugs. I used it to kill carpet and kitchen insects and as far as I can tell it was very effective. So I cannot comment on the uses intended for it. It's easy to use and has a lot of useful attachments.
1,"Great selection of lamps at an affordable price: I just bought two of these lights it's great, and a good product for any budget."
0,"I hate it: I hated this broom, it's so noisy and its suction power is so little. I wouldn't recommend this product."
0,"Upset: Owning and using this printer was a very frustrating experience. The prints appear dark in color. This printer should be left on at all times all the time because if you turn it off, it requires 3 full size glossy sheets of paper to be able to realign the printheads - waste of ink and paper! It was expensive, taking up so much space, that I wasn't really happy with it. I will give it zero stars if I can.."
0,The binoculars gave a double image: I was very disappointed when I looked through the binoculars and saw a double image that couldn't be corrected. I had to return them to refund.
0,Don't buy this !!!: The worst printer I've got so far. Painfully slow. Paper is constantly jaming. Very troublesome. Persistent spam messages appear indicating that the printer is online. I will be back to use Epson printers next time.
0,"Disappointed: the grill was nice, roast the chicken nicely. I enjoyed this grill during the few months that I have been working effectively. When you contact the customer service department of this company, it turns out that it is just a laughing stock, a rude and a waste of time ... I will not buy this brand again."
0,"The game broke in a few weeks: The game looked very elegant - until it was broken a few weeks later, it is frustrating .. there are no more voices anymore. It was tough for me."
0,"A few months after we bought the TV, we noticed dark gray spots on the screen. Fortunately, the TV was still under warranty as it was repaired right away. Then we recently got a blue spot in the bottom corner of the TV. We are still able to watch TV right now but not for long, so we can find out later that the cost of repairing it is more than buying a new TV."
0,This review is for the product and seller. I dislike this product. It's huge and very uncomfortable. I am surprised how people can sleep in it. I am very small so I asked for XS it was too big. It did not provide any back support and did not help to stand up .. I have never used the product and have to pay the return shipping fee. I ended up paying $ 17 out of my pocket just to try the stupid thing. It is not worth it.
0,"Don't bother getting this book. It is a load of waste. Even worse. The advice provided in this book is bad advice, and if you follow it, you will end up at best being laughed at you, at worst because the IRS's money in penalties and benefits is more than it was when you started. You may lose your car, or lose your home, and people have already tried and lost the ideas in this book. Do not buy this book! If you need a book to help you deal with the IRS, there are much better books than this one."
0,"Bad experience: It was not the TV that was received that was filmed in the description advertised on Amazon. The TV you received, the speakers are on the bottom, not on the sides. The company offered a $ 20 discount or returned it to my account (over $ 50). It seems I got stuck with it."
0,"Wrong keyboard: 1) 64350 is for Mac computers only, not for PC! 2) The product image (white keyboard) you see here on Amazon is not the keyboard you will receive. After promising a full refund (including shipping), and after returning the keyboard, the office didn't return the full amount for the keyboard plus taxes! After contacting and complaining, they again said that they would provide a full refund. 4) It was more than a week ago and the office did not correct the incorrect keyboard image on this webpage."
0,"Disappointing documentation: This film, especially the third disc, is disappointing. I thought it would be something based on real facts, but instead of saying things the way they are, the information is manipulated. Spend your money on something worthy."
0,Waste of time and money: Nothing on this CD is worth watching. Don't bother buying it !!
0,"It's like stealing !: You buy the program, and when you try to use it, you get error messages containing ""some files not installed"", or ""try again"". You are trying to contact Symantec, via email or other technical assistance. This will cost you $ 30. I used Norton from the first time and it was good, even excellent."
0,"Doesn't work on a Mac: It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"""
0,"Very disappointing: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts to play he was no longer able to use the mouse through any of the games. You use the up and down arrows on the keyboard - which is very difficult for him and not so much fun. I am very disappointed with this game and hope to bring it back. """
0,"A waste of money: I bought this game last year, for my two and a half year old son. I was thrilled about it, but what a mockery, half the time it didn't work, the graphics are awesome. This game is difficult to learn for 3 year old children. . Children feel frustrated while playing a game with black graphics only. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."
0,Do not waste your hard earned money by buying this game: This game system is an absolute waste of money. It stopped working in the first week since its purchase. She was returned to the store where she was replaced. The second game was broken after two months. Do not buy this type of toys.
0,"Blurry pictures: We bought this camera so we could take photos during land trips from a cruise ship. We had booked beach trips and wanted to risk the camera on water adventures. The price was right. But due to the protective case used to protect the camera from water, almost all of my photos appeared blurry. I'm sure this is due to the fact that the case is made from molded plastic."
0,"A waste of time: This book was a preacher, simplistic, boring and not helpful. It was neither motivational nor informative but was a waste of money and time."
0,"Very unhappy: I have to say the seller was very good at shipping the item. The thing I am not satisfied with is the ad for this product, which states that it was of high capacity and works with high capacity products."
0,"The card does not work: After I opened the package and inserted the card into my computer, the computer did not recognize the card. I also tried using my digital camera, and the camera said the card was not helpful. This is the first bad interface I encountered in the package. I returned the card and am very disappointed. """
0,"Worst !: A complete waste of time. Bad typos, grammatical errors, and a completely pathetic novel scenario don't add anything at all. A big disappointment when I paid for this novel."
0,"Don't try to fool us with fake comments: It's quite clear that all the glowing comments were written by the same person, maybe the author himself. They all have the same spelling mistakes and structure as bad sentences in the book."
0,"The worst art book I have ever read! : If ""0 Stars"" was available, I would have chosen it! This book is full of mistakes. I am so frustrated with the content of this book, its mistakes and the lack of information, that I stopped reading it in Chapter 7! I am very disappointed in this book. This particular book is not worth the $ 49.99 you have spent to include it in my reference material library, and I will not recommend it to our students here at our accredited technical training center."
0,"This kettle is a waste of money: we loved the design of this kettle (as per picture) with a capacity of 1.7 liters. So we ordered it, and when it arrived, it turned out to be a cheap product. The base is very light and flimsy. We did return it but the main reason for returning it to Amazon is a strong and persistent plastic smell that we couldn't get rid of after a week of trying - boiling it several times with baking soda, vinegar and water only - nothing helped. So, it was brought back to Amazon. Never order this scrap again!!"""
0,The sizes are much smaller than shown in the ad. I think you shouldn't buy this product online ... better go to the store and check it out
0,"It works, but not the way it was announced: I bought one of these chargers ... The instructions say the lights stay on while the battery is charging ... Correct. The instruction does not say that the lights go out when finished. This is also true. 24 hours charging and the lights remain on. I thought I had a bad charger, and the new charger did the same. Useless lights seem to always remain stationary."
0,"Waste of money: These things are not important, directives but useless. Do not waste your time or money on this. It is pure scrap. """
0,Not recommended: a very confusing reading. Difficult to follow. There is not much to learn from this story. The life story was very unimportant and you will not consider it as a good spiritual story.
0,"No thanks: What is this book? All I can say about this book is that it is: not original. Not convincing. Not at a reasonable price. Not smart. Not wise, wait: it's just preaching. This is what it is."
0,"Disappointed: i read the comments, i made the purchase and i was very disappointed. The charger is suitable for charging all four batteries at once but charging lasts for a very short time. Now I have to go and find the batteries that will give me more life than Kodak batteries."
0,"Disappointed: I am not at all happy with this product. I got this electric kettle one day after ordering it. I bought it based on the excellent service we got from the T-Fal boiler. I connected it and it worked the first time only !!!! After that, the key remained disabled. I returned it and recovered the amount."
0,"I think this book was really out of the ordinary. Comments about the book have been entirely made by the authors. I work as a junior banker for one of the 3 best companies, I can say the rules in the book are bad. And it is a joke that you can call it also, that there is some culture and literature in this book."
0,Defective: My binoculars were defective - the problem with lenses . Perhaps they were not aligned? Fortunately Amazon's return service was easy and fast for a refund.
0,"It's been sitting on my shelf for over 3 years....: When I got it, I read the first chapter, got bored and when on to another book. It's been sitting on my shelf ever since, I think that says enough. Want a good read about investment banking? Read F.I.A.S.C.O by Frank Partnoy - even better than Liar's Poker."""
0,"Amazing ! ! Why did this book get a one star rating? Because it is clear that those who read it are as shallow as the authors? Because competition on the subject is similarly weak? I read 75 books a year. This is the worst book I've ever seen - as I remember. The authors are seduced by themselves and shallow. This book is not very interesting, not informative and not fun. If you want this book, pay the shipping fee and I will send it to you for free. I'm not kidding! Until then you will feel deceived!"
0,"Bad plastic taste: This kettle produces water with a bad plastic taste when boiled. This makes them completely unsuitable for making tea. I've heard that some other people have got it to produce great-tasting water, but I'm giving it up, two weeks after trying"
0,"Not what I expected: The products of this company are always of high quality and evaluation. She has owned many perspectives for decades, but this group cannot be modified. It was not suitable for eyes (too narrow) that could not be expanded enough to give a clear view. All I got was double vision. Also, there is no guarantee, nothing !!!!! I do not know . This product may be defective. Sorry, I returned it"
0,"This book, although a little entertaining, was terribly written. If you are interested in banking, it is a good story book about life as a banker. I hope the reading audience realizes that every aspect of the book has been overrated. We bankers are not that arrogant - the eighties are over!"
0,"Strange, bad writing and movie as a drinking game. Save your money and buy something else useful instead."
0,Bad plastic smell and taste: I had this kettle a few weeks ago and tried everything in its manual to get rid of the smell and taste of plastic. Nothing worked and I was not prepared to know whether or not the odor would disappear after two months of use. How many bad cups of tea does this company expect to drink?
0,"Not good: the cover broke from the first time I tried to use it, and because charging it again would be expensive. I will not buy this again."
0,"Save time and money - do a Google search to get information on the topic. This book has no value, all that the author mainly advertises on his websites."
0,Very weak product: This company should not manufacture or sell these products. When I use it I cannot focus at all. I had a headache by using it for less than a minute. I have three other perspectives and they all work much better than these. Very disappointing.
0,"Incredibly terrifying !: I feel I have to write a few comments to prevent others from wasting their money. This book appears to have been written by a seventh grader with poor grammar skills! As another reviewer notes, there is a typo on the cover, and I think there is at least one for each chapter. For example , . I was so distracted by poor writing and poor script, that I decided to read with a pencil in the hand to mark all the grammatical rules and terrible spelling. Please do not waste your money on such a book."
0,"Problem charging AAA size battery: I got this charger more than 2 years ago. Charging AA batteries is ok, but it has a huge problem charging AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries, you need to flip the little button on the positive electrode and follow a specific method for charging. It is a tiring process."
0,"Maybe I got a bad one: My experience: I got this from FM, not from Amazon. The DVD player sometimes beats loudly when I put a DVD. The picture quality was not very impressive, and a horizontal line in the middle of the screen did not disappear. Plus one of the other reviewers died because of the remote control - it makes no sense to plan at all! Very poor human engineering. I brought him to the store to get the money back."
0,Waste money: The suction process of this cordless vacuum cleaner is so weak that it does not pick up anything from the hardwood floor in our house! It is very very frustrating
0,"Not a solid oar: This oar has very limited durability. After buying oars, they were all broken down because their handles were rubber."
0,"Cheap Telescope: The lenses are not aligned correctly, so you can see two round views instead of one that you can see in a high-quality telescope."
0,"Disappointing: this book does not provide actual information for lunch. Contains limited amounts of recipes. Some are as obvious as adding fruit and milk to granola storage, or others like adding ice cream to coffee. There are breakfast books and much better information than this book."
0,This movie was fine but I definitely thought it would be better ... The music was boring and repetitive and there were only a few seasons on DVD that were interesting to watch..In general I was disappointed with this movie.
0,Waste money: The suction power of this wireless vacuum cleaner is so weak that it can't pick up anything from the hardwood floor in our house! Very very frustrating.
0,"Difficult boiler: It continues to boil even when the boiler is removed from the base. The shape, thickness and position of the handle also make griping and spilling very difficult for my arthritis. I returned this kettle. """
0,Not as I expected: I didn't like this book at all. I really thought this would be a really good puzzle book but I was wrong. I do not recommend this book.
0,"Ridiculous: This is a bad attempt to teach kids self-control. Children learn to control pulses, either in real situations or they may pretend to be situations. It is really ridiculous."
0,"Not so amazing: I bought these little boxes because they looked good. However, they were not found to be. The perspectives arrived with one of the lenses significantly curved inside. I brought them back to amazon without any hassle. The official who helped me over the phone was very nice and sent me a replacement the next day. The replacement of the dual images looked good at first but then I noticed that the lenses were slightly twisted. . I wouldn't recommend this. If I have to do it again, I will pay a little bit more for something better."
0,"Disappointment: My five-year-old son has been playing this game for months. He was very happy when he got it for his birthday. But it was a disappointment to all of us, and the game became a nightmare. Its pieces fall with just a simple touch. Additionally, we could not find a car that works well with it. Some were very light while others were very heavy. Either way, we had trouble getting cars to walk over the slope of this game. After a disappointing few days trying to play with her, my five-year-old son suggested getting rid of her."
0,"Not so good: I looked forward to getting this one, but I was very disappointed. There is a plastic thread inside one of the lenses in the field of view. Alignment must be stopped because double vision cannot be set to exit."
0,"Very bad product: it worked fine for some time but after a few months of use the problem of ""imbalance"" that a lot of customers experienced started. Very disappointed the product is very bad. do not buy."
0,Not working: I purchased this product before and there were no problems but the last time the spray nozzle was broken so I couldn't even use the spray can.
0,"Don't buy from distributors all over the world: I ordered several products through Amazon and I was very satisfied. However, this TV arrived 4 days after the expected charging date, and after that, it didn't turn on when connected. After further investigations, it turned out that the on / off switch is completely missing from the back of the TV. The officials I called to return the TV told me that it would not be accepted all over the world. It is annoying !!! do not buy !!!"
0,"Not good for students and beginners: Despite its proper athletic look, this book is full of inaccuracies. The author moves from one topic to another using unexplained terms (especially in examples) that confuse and mislead the reader. And references are often insufficient. In my opinion, the book can be used by experienced bioinformatics experts as an unnecessary desk reference. Beginners and serious students should stay away from it. """
0,"Too bad design: I bought this water boiler due to the many good comments on Amazon. However, it turned out to be one of the worst boilers I have ever had. It took me 4 years to get a good boiler of water and the only reason to throw it was because it got too dirty inside. The design of this kettle leaves a lot to be desired. . Moreover, the handle fell after about a month of use. . In general, I am not quite sure why it is so rated. I give it one star. """
0,Not what I thought it would be...: This movie was okay but I definitly thought it was going to be better..the music was boring and redundant and there were only a few chapters on the DVD that were interesting to watch..overall I was disappointed with this movie.
0,Worst book: This is the first book of this author that I had no desire to finish. It is the worst book he has written so far.
0,"Say no to Akai. It will only work for a few days.: I bought a Akai LCD TV 3 months ago. It is dead now. No sound and no picture. Their customer service was terrible, also. I will not ever buy this brand any more."""
0,Disappointed: This case was not as strong as the other cases I had before. It is also more difficult to close.
0,"Plastic Taste and Smells: The water vapor emitted has a plastic smell. This is after following the manufacturer's instructions which state that the water solution and baking soda should be boiled to remove any plastic odor or taste. I did this four or five times. But the smell and taste remain. In fact, the smell is there even once the boiler is dried. The plastic of this kettle obviously releases some kind of chemicals into the water. The harmful aftertaste of boiling water in this kettle is so strong that the water or tea made from it is not drinkable. I have returned this kettle to Amazon.com. """
0,"Buyer Beware !!: I ordered a cake for a birthday party, but it didn't receive me on the specified date. I contacted the seller twice without reply. I received two weeks after ordering, and it was not on demand! The seller returned my money, but he never called me or apologized for the accident. I will not buy anything from the seller again."
0,"Not worth the paper printed on: I have read and liked all the books written by this author in the legal field. But this book is boring. Full of prose and prose prose and slow, slow, slow. I couldn't finish this book - boring"
0,"Completely upset: This wireless vacuum cleaner was absolutely useless. It does not suck and does not pick up even the smallest amount of hair, dust or paper. I'm really really annoyed because Black & Decker products have always been completely reliable, and since then I've returned it  and I'm trying to find a replacement."
0,Very Bad: This was a very disappointing purchase ... very poor quality ... The people who support this movie may know these people and then they like the movie ... It is a very poor quality film ... a waste of money.
0,"Bad customer service !: My problem is not in the product, my main customer service problem. First, they listed the product as ""available"" while in fact ""out of stock."" Email me to let me know it will take 5 to 7 more days to receive the order and then send it to me. I understood their position. I finally received my shipment 3 weeks after submitting my order. Would I buy them again, no! Look for another seller who understands what good customer service is."
0,"Don't waste your money: this TV completely died in less than a year. First, I had a problem with playback. Then he died completely, and nothing works. It is also impossible to reach customer service in this company. Do not waste your money on this product. """
0,"Stupid book: This book is very stupid .... What plot does it contain? No mystery, nothing !!! Just a bunch of writing"
0,Filthy: Really NOT suitable for family viewing. I threw it away after stopping it as my teenage son watched. Poor quality also.
0,"300 pages in this book and nothing interesting yet: nothing interesting has happened. Boring. The characters are not interesting and the writing style has no color at all. I stopped reading this author's works because I finally realized that a man could not write. """
0,"The worst so far: I enjoyed all the books of this author except this book. This book is a sleeping pill. Only one word better describes it. Boring!"""
0,Don't waste your money: the worst series of books I've rented and I'm glad I didn't buy it. It is just waste. 
0,"*** Beware ***: It turns out that the settings for this TV do not include a ""back"" button, as well as the remote control that comes with the TV, so I bought Sony globally, which is a much better remote control, has a ""back"" button on him. This may not be a big deal for some, but it is quite annoying for someone like me."
0,"Big disappointment ..: The result is a musical boring drama. Given how good the album is and how long fans have had to wait for the second release, this is a huge disappointment. Because the songs are bad, the sound is bad and the product is bad. This is not good, I think the change in line-up  has a lot to do with this; obviously the real musician / songwriter left the band."
0,"Not working: I bought the Rumba wireless broom out of four failed brooms. It does not clean well. Out of charge faster than me. it get confused when it hits the walls. I just don't understand how anyone can look this as a great product, all i know is i bought 4 and it all ended up in the trash."
0,Terrible product: I don't see any improvement due to the itch problem. It is mentioned in the brochure that this product is under a satisfaction guarantee. I called customer service and noticed that the seller misled will give you the manufacturing phone number and then when you call them they will tell you that you should contact the seller to return your product.
0,"This book is terrible. I can't understand how this terrible thing was posted. With so many grammatical errors and irrelevant points, this book was hard to understand. Is there such a thing as zero stars ???? """
0,"Disposable Electronics: Roomba's idea is smart and can be useful during the warranty period but then it is essentially disposable tools. IRobot, the manufacturer, has cut many corners to produce this smart device at a reasonable price without providing parts. Five stars during the warranty period, one star after that.."
0,Complete hogwash: Throughout history Blacks have served only two purposes: slave labor and amusing others. This book falls in the latter category.
0,Not as I thought it would be: I ordered this book for my grandchildren. The age range assigned to this book is inappropriate. The words are confusing and well beyond the learning stage of the intended age group.
0,"They are made very cheaply. I wouldn't recommend this: this product looks great in the photo, but upon arrival it was so bad that I sent it on the spot. The lower plastic part is improperly fastened. The ""copper"" exterior parts were also cheap and seemed to change color instantly. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
0,Not exciting: I never liked a book that was carelessly written. It is better to spend money somewhere else.
0,poor new design: I purchased this to replace our older one. We have the same mat but was stained from red sauce. This new mat has different suction cups that do not work. So it fails to stay put.
0,"There is not much to say: Purchasing this type of glove is always a good business. This is the third pair that I bought, and they were all good quality, etc. It is not a protective glove in the world (therefore, look for the impact-resistant type), but it is stiff, good, and definitely helps in dealing with heat problems."
0,"That's not what I expected ...: As a graphic artist, this book was a book about molds, and I personally created and did much better than what appeared here. This is the last book I bought for this author"
0,"Don't buy this game: this is a terrible game, I mean, it's totally stupid. Fish represent real pain when caught. Moreover, the game contains the worst music I have ever heard. Strange controls to get new levels you need to overcome challenges that are impossible. You have very little time to catch many really rare fish. Do not waste your time or money buying such a game"
0,"Disappointment: I am very disappointed with this program. It crashes and looks very slow. I expected something much better than a product that cost a lot. I need to create some written messages for my clients, so I don't know what to do. I would have no choice but to buy another product. I have to get my job done and I shouldn't be constantly frustrated by the way the program falters."
0,"horrible: This is one of the worst albums of priests, a good nightclub only for 12 year old kids"
0,"Sad, sad, sad: I was so excited to get this book and then realized it was just a real advertisement of books that customers use. If you browse this book, on each page you will see the website of the books of these authors. We are educated people and we cannot stop quoting the book we are reading. Unfortunately very unhelpful."
0,"Inherent battery  problem:After a month of use, this phone no longer has the ability to charge. I returned it and got a new one. Now the new device does not charge too. This could be a wrong model for design."
0,"Waste: it is simply a bad product. I bought it completely new, without scratches, but the disc acted like I had scratched it terribly. . We were never able to finish the game because it will return to the main menu after midway through any game. The disc may be damaged, and if not, then it can only be said that it is a bad product."

1,"Great chair for the money: This chair is great for what I paid for it! It was easy to assemble, it is comfortable for short periods of time (under an hour) and it glides very comfortably. The white paint is bright white and the beige is a nice khaki beige. It will be the perfect rocking chair for our little one when he/she arrives. I "
1,"Excellent soundtrack: I really love this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I played this game and I enjoy most of the music it's really comfortable. My favorite soundtracks: Scars of Time, Between Life and Death, Illusion Forest, Ancient Dragon Castle, Lost Fragment, and Valley of Sinking. Overall, they are excellent audio clips."
1,Worked Great!: Great Product! the quality is great nice Glass construction. Will buy more products from them in the future.
1,"Glorious story: The story was amazing and was pleasantly surprised by the changes in the book. I'm not an ordinary person in romance novels, but the world was encouraging this book, so I bought it. loved it !! This is a great story because it is true. This book was so cool that I told all my friends to read it. It's not a typical romance, it's much more than that."
1,"Best Soundtrack Ever: I read a lot of comments saying that this is the best ""audio track for games"". It's timeless music and I've been listening to it for years now. Simply her beauty refuses to fade. He is the only one who I feel is worth every penny."

1,"Good: No complains here. Got them in time, and placing them on the razor is fairly straightforward. Works like a charm."""
1,"Great book: This was a great book, which I couldn't leave, and I could not read it fast enough. A book that keeps you in a state of longing, guessing, and a desire to know what will happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can also make you very angry. This book can make you go through many of your feelings. It's a fast-read romance. It is something you want to end your day with if you read it at night."
1,"Good product: This is a good product. I use it because it keeps the bathtub clean without having to clean it. The price at amazon is competing with the stores. I received it within days of my order to her. Sometimes I find it hard to find it in stores, so I like buying it here, about 6 boxes at a time. I will always use it. """
1,Excellent: This product cannot be found anywhere near home

1,"Excellent item : I would order from this seller again. Service was great, as stated, securely wrapped and received sooner than expected."""
1,Excellent cord for cold weather use: I purchased this to use with a Toro Power Shovel (snow Plow). Standard extension cords were too stiff in the bitter cold we sometimes experience. This cord is much better. I wasn't sure of the blue color but it stands out better in the snow than yellow or orange cords I used before. I recommend this cord if you need one for use in the cold and snow.

1,Good read: It was a good book. Would recommend it to anyone and will read the rest of the series. Kept me interested.
1,"Oh please: I think you should be a fan of the romance novel of this author, who is so unpopular that this novel is utter nonsense.

1,"Nice rocking chair Price: I love the rocking chair although it's smaller than I had hoped and the cushions are very thin. It looks expensive but once you get into it, you realize you've got what you paid for. I would keep this rocker r but if I had a choice I would have bought something bigger and more comfortable."

1,"Good: This blanket is very soft, very warm, very light weight, and very reasonably priced. It would be five stars if it were a little longer, but if you don't need a blanket to cover you head to toe, it is fine. I like it a lot and will buy another one."
1,"Cute, but small: This chair is very cute, sturdy and well-made. The only thing is that it is very narrow especially for a fat person like me, I will return it and choose a larger chair or choose different chair. Great chair suitable for the price. I recommend it"

1,very fun...light workout for beginners.: Okay I had a lot of fun doing this workout. This dvd is good for a beginner. I am overweight but I have been working out for a couple of months in the gym.

1,Great air purifier!: I purchased this air purifier despite some bad reviews. I'm so glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews. It is absolutely wonderful and does a great job. I really wish I had bought two at the same time.. And as far as how it works the proof is in the filter. I can't believe how much dust/dirt it is removing from the air in my home. A wonderful buy!

1,"Okay, so I got this game cause it has a catchy name and looks fun, this game tiresome  ! I like funny games"
1,This hair dryer is big and heavy but thankfully it dries hair pretty quickly and doesn't seem to damage my fine hair like other super hot dryers. I don't have tons of thick hair so it works for me but people with long thick hair would also have tired arms.
1,"Beautiful colors: I bought this kite and others for a family vacation at the beach. We had a wonderful time, in the early evening, and these groups flew to the beach. This plane has a vibrant color and long arms. It looks beautiful in flying over the ocean. A great fun experience for anyone! . Buy it for a family member, friend, gift or better, and buy it for yourself !!!! """
1,"Awesome bag !!!!!: I got this bag for quite some time now, even with some drawbacks it is a good bag. Strongly recommend it"

1,Excellent Backpack. Lots of space for all stuffs you carry with you everyday. Great support and lots of padding for the electronics.
1,"Great Book!: This is an awesome book for someone that is new to the teach profession or even a struggling teacher. This book goes through all the things that could occur in your classroom and how to handle them. It has great examples of things that could go wrong and has the best way to handle them, plus keep instruction going in the classroom. I recommend this book to anyway that has trouble managing their class. It's great!!!"
1,Great product: It is a fantastic product! My hair looks natural and I receive many compliments on how much younger it makes me look!
1,Overall - quite satisfied.: This dryer is nice. I don't know if it's any faster but it does work well and my hair really does feel shinnier and healthier. It is a bit heavier than I was used to but not problematicly so.
1,Best book I've ever read!!!:  this author  is  my favorite author! . All of  characters are amazing and the story in just awesome. This book is just loads of fun. I loved this book!
1,Very informative: The healthcare challenge is one that will take a lot to change. I think the book outlines the issues really well and makes you think about what is required to change the healthcare system. The question now is how do undertake such a massive overhaul?
1,"Excellent purchase!: Item came shipped in a manageable size box, on-time, and ready to put on the tractor. It couldn't have been easier!"
1,"Simple and easy to use. Quick installation.: Easy to set up (disk required). Can use with any PC and with any messaging program, such as Skype or with MSN.Better quality than on my netbook built-in webcam.I have not tested the sound quality yet."
1,"Stability with Comfort: I have to admit this car seat is great, my son loves it and usually instantly falls asleep every time he is in it. 1 downfall is I always have a hard time pushing the front belt into place, there should be an easier design."
1,"I like my Printer...: Very fast, efficient and quiet! Very pleased with my purchase. Have not used scanner yet."
1,"Best For Price: Wonderful router for such a low price... works fine through many interferences - including cordless telephone, microwave, etc -- and a very long distance. Runs two laptops and an XBOX, without any problems."
1,"Simply fun: let me summarize this in 3 words,  This game is very fun and very fun (graphics), completely new graphics and smooth gameplay . You should buy this, and buy it you won't be disappointed. There are over 100 missions to do.The cool AI game makes this game very difficult, and it is another great, exciting , and fun game"
1,awesome: Great laser printer..you cant go wrong with the price. I've had this printer for a while and I use it everyday to make copies for my class. I haven't had any trouble with it. Saves me a ton of money in replacing the ink for my inkjet printers.
1,"Imaginative: This toy set strikes a great balance in engaging children and their imagination at play. The items seem durable enough to handle rough treatment. One concern: the sounds might become a bit annoying to frazzled parents, especially when used in a small interior space. On the positive side with sound: there are no batteries intensifying the noise."
1,"inspirational movies: Both of these movies were excellent. They both leave you with wonderful feelings: amazement, pride, encouragement, inspiration, and faith in humanity. I love a movie that is uplifting. There is so much negative ""entertainment"" available today, it is great to find something positive and actually worth watching."
1,"very involving story, contains one of her best female protagonists. starts out a tragic figure and becomes by the end, a clever, determined and complex character. . As usual, the author tops off the adventure with some nice final twists."""
1,"Good Product: Good product for what it is, but I hardly ever use it these days"
1,A solid performer at a reasonable price: Rock-solid router. . Now I'm using it behind my actiontec DSL modem because I was unhappy with the wireless coverage of the verizon modem/router. It really does what I need it to do right out of the box.
1,"Pleasant and Enjoyable: This CD really is a joy to listen to. These Chants  get in my head and don't come out all day. That's actually a good thing though- these Chants are incredible. The music is and comfortable.  one of the best Chants I have ever heard in my life, and the original release is on this disc. . Really, you cannot go wrong with this album- it's great."
1,"nice buy: im very pleased with this product nice size holds everything i need. material breaths well,plus it looks good!! thanks !!"
1,"Yes, I love it :): Excellent product, perform as advertised. I'll recommend it. Customer support is great and it comes from Cisco. What else can I ask for."
1,"Great fan: There are some days when the temperature isn't high enough to run your air conditioner. So I decided to buy this  fan. Must say, this fan not only looks great, but also circulates air well. But the best part is, I now use my air conditioner only during peak summer days and this fan has helped cut my electricity bill drastically. I highly recommend this product."
1,Good camera: Bought this camera to stay in touch with frends and family . Worked as advertised and at a good price. The software is basic but not really that important since all I care about is having the driver loaded. Works perfect on Skype. I recommend this product if you are lookng for a web cam and dont want to spend to much.
1,"Love this hairdryer, especially for the price: My old hairdryer was burning my hair and making it frizzy, not to mention taking about 45 minutes to dry my hair. This dryer does it in half the time with no frizz. It has hot, warm, and cold settings - I love this. It is a great buy for the technology behind it. It is a must have!"
1,"this tool  is a great idea. Unfortunately, this tool is under powered . I found it  useful for hobby projects like cutting wood, cardboard  ,plastic etc.My other two problems with this tool are no.1 it is way too loud and no.2 it gets too hot during use.Clever idea but disapointing quality and performance."""
1,The music on this Movie was the best part. At times the story was a little non-believable character wise- but it kept our attention.
1,Great movie: Enjoyable for the whole family and carries a great message. Great to see good outdoor sport shots with beautiful scenery.
1,"Almost perfect but had defect: Received wallet and was completely satisfied at first. There was plenty of storage and not too big in size. However, the zipper kept sticking at one corner making it difficult to close the wallet. I had to return item and was so disappointed as I have been looking for something like this for a long time."
1,"A very handy item.:  . This money clip is a big help. It lets me extract money without having to remove most of the contents of my pockets. It is easy to open or close, very light weight and holds money together very well. I liked the price it was delivered very quickly."
1,The cables look flimsy and a little thin but they work fine.
1,I love this new hair dryer it is heavy yet so fast that I don't have to hold it and hold it for long. It hair dries in a few minutes and leaves it soft and straight without any frizz at all. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,"The is clear, easy to install and works great!"
1,"Great quick read! Not just an entertaining look but an insightful tutorial on creative sales and marketing techniques. I recommend it to anyone looking for inspiration and a fresh perspective on their own business endeavors. Really unique - unlike any other business book you've ever read. """
1,"Nice shirt!: Affordable and shipper was very fast. I would recommend this to anyone . Very nice quality and still after many washes looks brand new. I usually order up a size, to make room for shrinking, but these do not shrink at all. Nice fit."""
1,Excellent product: I purchase this item for my granddaughter to teach her how to write. She love using it. I would recommend this product to any one who wants to teach their children how to write.
1,"Great great product; brighter blue color as pictured, deep scoops, and long handles. Have cleaned by hand and dishwasher, no issues."""
1,Good service--and these terrific CD holders are hard to find now. So glad I found this store which sell it. Hope they keep them in stock.
1,Excellent Book: This book is very well written. It presents both sides of the conflict from a very human perspective. We get to feel the internal conflict of each person as well as learning about the actual battle. Well worth the money and the time
1,nice quality: Seems like a good quality shirt. Does not get all stretched out of shape after being worn.
1,"Perfect  Great movies - great collection - for the price, I just had to get it."
1,"Fabulous book!: Read this book ... you'll love it! Because I love reading this writer’s articles every Sunday in this magazine. She writes smartly and wisely. You will laugh out loud and you'll go to cry. I was very sad when the book ended because I wanted more. It's a really a delightful book! """
1,"best game I've played for awhile: It has probably been about ten years since I've enjoyed a video game as much as I have enjoyed this game. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent- however the fun factor makes this game great! This is one of the rare games you won't be able to stop playing until you have mastered it."
1,"My five year old loves his voice changer. In fact everyone in the house plays with it. I like how you can use multiple switches to make even more that 10 different effects. Fun, but if you have a headache or are bothered by noise then do not buy this!"
1,"Great show!: love this show, my husband and I love watching it together- the characters are so compelling and I love the stories!"
1,"Cool toy: My boy loves helicopters, and there are a lot to choose from...but this one is sturdy, fun, and the design is cool!"
1,Excellent: I love this product. I take it every night with a little tart cherry to help me relax and sleep.
1,Arrives fast: Exactly what i needed and it arrives fast less than 2 days. This book is great for ESOL class. It's a lot cheaper here that buying it in the library or somewhere else.
1,Best router ever made: I've had this router for maybe 5 + years now  and its been great the entire time. The only time it gave me any issue (it was my fault for resetting it)  . great reception . The range is not great but its not bad either. it's a high quality product.
1,"Beautiful Watch, However It Does Not Work!!!: Deeply Disappointed In the WorkmanshipThis is the second watch I have ordered from Amazon. The first one, shoddy workmanship. The second  watch simply does not work. I will be returning this one tomorrow."
1,Good Stuff: Reasonable price. Outstanding quality. Variety of uses. A+. Can't go wrong with this tool. I am thinking about buying a couple more as gifts.
1,Excellent: You'll have to read all 4 books. They are wonderful and full of history. I can't decide which one i love the most.
1,"An excellent game: Very fun and interesting game. The battle moves are awesome! Great graphics and gameplay. Moves along at a great pace, not too hard, not too easy. It is a game that should not be missed!!"
1,"This is a really good book. It has great coverage of difficult topics, a sign of a good book. It's very complete and easy to read. .  the book is outstanding and I think it is ideal for a third year medical student to use this during the medicine clerkship. .

1,GOOD CAM: Hey Guys this is a nice cam to use.I like this cam its clear to use the clarity of cam is excellent
1,great printer: I really needed a printer with a scanner so I could store my important files digitally. This printer works great.. I would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster. It can scan color also but that takes a loooong time. b&w has been sufficient for me; scans quickly for those. printout quality is excellent.
1,SO CUTE!: My girls like these iPod sleeves. Cute colors and they do a great job of protecting them from getting dropped and dirty. I just wish their were more colors available. But no worries. I'm a very happy customer!
1,Very nice watch: This watch looks  better  ; it's a very classy watch. I think it looks very good on me. I  like  because it is very  light  and I hardly notice that I'm wearing it. I only gave 4 stars because the numbers for the date and time are on  small side.
1,Best Gift: Great value and will bring enjoyment to those who watch it. Great gift idea to give to your significant other.

1,haven't found better yet...: This is the only product that can manage my hair without making it stiff or sticky.
1,"smoothing serum: The product is wonderful for my hair which is very curly and tends to be frizzy. Smooths it and gets rid of allof the friz. Use it once a day, even in damp weather"""
1,"I have a narrow foot. Sometimes straps are too wide, but these shoes fit me perfect.The sole was not very padded, so I bought inserts to put inside. Now I find these shoes to be very comfortable."""

1,a really fun car: Excellent car for both kids and adults. My two kids ten years apart and love to play together. It has a wonderful design for the shape and color and very durable.
1,excellent product: The product works really well. We have used it several times with no problems. The suction is strong. The only complaint is I wish the cord was longer.
1,"Good Price - Good Product: I was a little wary of buying this toilet paper since I'm used to using super soft stuff, but this really works great. It's not the softest or most absorbent(in comparison to other name brands) but the fact that it's good for the environment and does it's job well, works for me. :)"
1,"Perfect: I needed a light, comfortable long-sleeve t-shirt for casual wear. and has exceeded my expectations. Good product."
1,I enjoy wearing this  shirt. The fit was right on. I use it to sleep in and it;'s very comfortable. I lookforward the buying many more of these in different colors.

1,Nice chair at a reasonable price: This chair is very comfortable and durable
1,A good read: The characters were interesting and the story kept me hooked until the end. I would recommend it to fans of the adventure lovers.

1,"Excellent Communication Skills Tool !: I almost read this book from cover to cover, found it interesting, useful, easy to read and can be applied to my work. Very useful advice on how to deal with all kinds of situations. . Professionally written, applicable to all types of situations, great for all levels of experience."
1,A good movie from start to finish!: You will enjoy every minute of this movie (assuming you like  adventures movies). There are some terrific scenes in this one.
1,"Great: Easy to set up, easy to use. Very accurate with minimal time lags"
1,"Excellent little notebook. I find the small size is just large enough to carry around, but still have plenty of room to write in comfortably."
0,"I brought it to the house and installed it, I went to the race and as soon as I came back until it fell, then reinstalled it, I think it is a bad goods and a waste of time, effort and money."
0,"After the water got into my first hour, I decided to buy this watch. I'm out of the house a lot and need something I can wear in the water with little maintenance. Unfortunately, this watch is defective, because the screw you use to set the time allows the water to enter directly. Oh my misfortune"
0,"While the book is useful on a shallow level, the introduction is weak. I was very disappointed, both in the quality of the book (cheap product; poor quality paper, blurry printing) and lack of promised insight. There are many better books!"
0,"This is the second Panasonic cordless phone that I have owned. the first one crashed and burned at 10 months . I waited several years before buying another Panasonic, and this phone has been worse than the first. The phone simply goes dead within a minute or two of answering or dialing. . Quite honestly, I will never buy another Panasonic phone. I feel like a chump for having wasted my money a second time"
0,"I bought this to help my son who has English language problems at school. This is just a cheap tradition of language speaking programs; No grammar, no vocabulary lists. This cannot be used by a student who is learning English. I can't imagine someone using it."
0,"I've tried many  cups in an effort to find one that doesn't leak. I purchased these  cups based on the reviews about how durable these  cups are and how they don't leak. However, as soon as I received the cups, I tested them out by turning them upside down.THEY LEAKED, . PLUS, THEY ARE NOT DURABLE! . Needless to say, I've very disappointed in this product and wished I would have returned them upon first noticing that they leak."""
0,"I guess I shouldn't have been disappointed but I am. I purchased it because I am a very small person and I thought that this would be the perfect size. However, it's much smaller than it appears. This ring is cheaper than I would have imagined. Not to mention that the ring was an imperfect circle. I wouldn't be surprised if it bent if I squeezed it. I am even more disappointed because Amazon did not send a certificate with it like they did when I purchased my previous ring. I do not recommend this ring to anyone.  This ring just doesn't look right."
0,"We opened the box, extracted the game, and it was immediately clear that it was defective and of poor quality. The thin plastic is very deformed, and the game parts cannot be installed properly."
0,Worst movie I've ever seen: This really is the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting and story are absolutely ridiculous. The four of us almost walked out of the theater when we saw it. I wish I had those 2 hours of my life back.
0,poor quality: I do not recommend anyone purchase these masks. They did not even last a day before they started to fall apart.
0,"This mask is awful. When we first opened the box, the scent of glue smelted. The outer part of the mask is elastic so it may look discolored when worn. It doesn't look stylish or cool at all. If you don't have a choice, that's fine. I suggest not buying this if you can wait and save money for a better mask."
0,"Do not buy!: The item appeared to have been used . Big disappointment and quite frankly embarrasing, as it was a birthday gift."""
0,BAD!!!!!!: It broke twenty minutes after we got it. If I were you do not waste your time with it. It is a piece of junk.
0,not worth it: This mask fell apart with in the first 2 hours of using it. It is not worth the money. Go to the market  and spend the extra 9 dollars and get a mask that will last. That's what we had to do.
0,poor quality: I do not recommend anyone purchase these masks. They did not even last a day before they started to fall apart.
0,"Still waiting for ""evidence"": From the title of this book, I thought it would provide actual evidence. At least, I expected some sort of controversy. This author does nothing - he quotes only a whole group of people who made the same conclusion, and none of them provide clues either. A disappointing book"
0,"I thought I would save some time preparing for my second child once I bought this product, instead of sewing more blankets that I made for my daughter. It is a big mistake !!! The type of fabric used in this blanket that I bought is very bad! Polyester lined."
0,"Great idea, terrible product: The idea of ??using this towel in a baby's car seat to prevent diaper leaks was very attractive. I bought a few quickly, but as soon as I throw it in the washer or even wash it by hand, the whole piece will dry crooked, losing the right shape. This is one of the things Theoretically good but not in practice unless the design and materials are corrected."
0,"Disappointing  and disgusting: These shows indicate disrespect for the original production. Were recording artists trying to make money? The sound quality and wording are very poor. . What a disappointment! This CD is not in honor of that musician, and certainly does not amount to being true to his wonderful spirit."
0,"Very disappointing: I was not the only one who had this happened. I am talking about disappointment. I have waited and waited for this product and I came to discover after a few weeks that I received an email saying that they no longer own this product, and I cannot even tell you how bothered you are, well actually I still am. I would rate this product with (zero stars) only because of how to handle this whole thing."
0,Disappointed: I waited and waited and waited and only after emailing the company did I find out I was not going to get my product !!!
0,"I would not classify this type of clothing as a ""coat"". ""The material is very lightweight, and is equivalent to an inexpensive jeans shirt. It looks good but certainly not what I expected from the description."
0,"I bought this for my son and I was upset with her. Once he sits on it, my son couldn't even touch the ground. Not to mention that it is not stable in any way, it turns over as soon as you touch it. Her age rating is completely wrong, and she must be 2 to 3 years old. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone wanting to buy a baby under 35 inches long."
0,"Useless bike !: The front wheel does not spin. It is completely useless. The picture may look good. However, it is a very disappointing product. I think it shouldn't be on the market."
0,"Readable, but where are the maps?: The book was interesting to someone who enjoys reading history. A definite disappointment when no maps or any other illustration appeared although frequently cited."""
0,"The worst response from amazon.com: nonsense response from amazon. We asked for a new product, but they sent us a used product. My daughter was ready to play, and when I opened the product, I found it used. I suggest everyone not to buy any material directly from amazon.com. I asked for compensation because of the inconvenience they  caused to my daughter . They did not respond to my inquiry. The worst customer service from amazon.com."
0,"Not Shipped a complete order: Missing tires, help! how can I get two more tires, it was a gift for my grandson, I have no paperwork."""
0,Do not waste your money on this game. I have two three-year-olds who brought this game for them. They could not ride her without falling off. The game is narrow and the wheels are not big enough to hold a 3-year-old.
0,"Stupid !!!!!: Well! This was one of the worst films I've ever seen! The plot twists in the movie were boring, great actors who failed an annoying failure, it was not fun to watch it, little movement, etc. etc. This is not a family movie! Children between 3 and 10 years old will feel incredibly bored and there is some bad language anyway. I have no idea how this movie won the Academy Awards?!?!?!"
0,"Watch it once and get rid of it: it's boring to watch movies of dysfunctional families trying to find their way to a normal life. Our culture has lost that sweet spirit and moral sense of the values ??that we previously had, and this film is the primary product of it. We will not show it to our children. The movie was bad enough that we threw it in the trash."
0,I thought I liked the movie when I was a child but now when I watched it with my niece I realized it wasn't good. The new version Disney brought out in the early 2000s is great.
0,"This movie could have been awesome but it is far from it, and perhaps one of the worst movies this producing company has ever made. It is slow moving, not new events. Just a waste of time"
0,"My son is obsessed with Disney cartoons, so it was natural for him to want to see this movie. Unfortunately, this movie totally lacks magic, I found everything flat, a replica. This is the worst thing I've seen"
0,"Readable, but where are the maps?: The book was interesting to someone who enjoys reading history. A definite disappointment when no maps or any other illustration appeared although frequently cited."""
0,"Lots of art, little food and accommodation: I was very disappointed in the book - I was expecting a lot of helpful advice on finding a comfortable hotel and cheap meal, but there was almost no information on these topics. Instead, the author provides brilliant details about the few items he believes to be seen in the major museums in London. Well, thanks, my taste for art is different from its taste."
0,"Not as good as other travel books: I am surprised by the positive comments this book has received. It is severely lacking in maps, the maps it contains are unclear, and there is no coordination between the descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail you'll find in some other books. Overall, I was very disappointed with this book."
0,"This is a very fun game for teenagers and adults. I would not recommend to young children without strict parenting guidance. Here's why: This is a game to play some evil roles. Which may be harmful to young people in pre-adolescence or immature age. This game is harmless for mature and older teens, and can be very exciting."
0,"This book looks like a boring ad-filled report. waste of time. I read it in the middle of it. Maybe I find something interesting. Unfortunately, nothing"
0,"Waste of money: This book is outdated and incorrect in many cases. The author provides data from the 1980s, and there is no real substance behind his recommendations. Frankly, I didn't get a single idea from this book. Do not waste your money! """
0,Poor quality: The sponge smells like some sort of chemical was used on it. The hand massage tool is indented. The bath salt smells just as bad as the sponge. I am honestly thinking about just throwing away a majority of this product and buying everything locally..
0,I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED TO FIND The PRODUCT HAD NO FRAGRANCE. IT ONLY HAS BODY WASH AND LOTION AND A BUNCH OF USELESS ITEMS. THERE IS NO BODY SPRAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE FOR THE PRICE.
0,IT WORRIES ME WHEN SELLERS DON'T PUT MEASUREMENTS: I don't trust sellers that don't add measurements and reliable information. They are always hiding something.
0,I am a huge fan of the first video. This one however was a big letdown. Neither of my daughters will pay attention to it. Over all I just wouldn't recommend this at all.
0,"Very small wipes canister, not very wet, small wipes, hard to pull out of container. With that said, I like the ingredients and the idea, but keep working on the formulation and engineering of packaging."
0,"waste of money. I just bought this game about 20 minutes ago. I played it for 5 minutes and wanted to throw it away. The graphics are weak, game play is choppy and it is an all around boring game. I really wished I rented it first. I am going to trade this one away a.s.a.p."
0,"very very disappointing: The picture & audio quality is very poor worse than a video tape ,maybe a bootleg copy."
0,Too small!: Was looking to put these on my car and they are just too small. I should have read the size closer before ordering.
0,So Disappointing! Hurts your ears: I received it as a gift the next Xmas. The blender does an okay job blending and it has a glass jar. That is about it for the positives. It is the loudest kitchen appliance I have ever heard. My ears ring after using it and sometimes it hurts my ears. Do not purchase this blender! This is the first time I have been disappointed.
0,"I bought this blender. After a few months of use, it just stopped working. Still under warrantee, I mailed it to the company . 2 months later they mailed me a new blender. Two months after the warrantee expired it stopped working again. I am disappointed"
0,"If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudite and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience."
0,Bought this blender a year ago to make smoothies using frozen fruit. I thought it worked great. Now the blades won't turn and the bottom rusting of all things.
0,Months of airing out can not take away the hideous stench coming out of this mats. Avoid at all costs.
0,"One might notice that many of the negative comments of this book contain horrible grammar and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked this book.I think this this book will be wonderful, if you are willing to put effort into understanding it."
0,"I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment."

0,"This is a terrible product! First of all, very small speakers and very short connection wires, they should only be used with a computer (although the instruction sheet indicates that they can be connected to other devices such as televisions, DVD players, etc.).

1,A nice collection of interview portions of some of the world's great ones is better than original interviews where people get a chance to talk more than interviewer

I am almost ashamed to admit, but I do nothing but sharpen it until I bought the whetstone a few weeks ago."
1,Great Kitchen Tool: The knife is well made and the blade is exceptionally sharp. The only draw-back is the handle which seems to small for the average hand.
1,"This knife I own is much better than (the more expensive large kitchen knives and sometimes slippery). I can use them with big things like watermelon, coconut, and small things like tomatoes. Its rim is very sharp, it's great, comfortable to use, the best among my knives, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is other cheaper Asian knives, although maybe not quite solid."

1,"I used 3 study books for this test, and it was the most comprehensive book by far, which succeeded in explaining topics in a way that could be easily understood and applied.

I found that logical CDs and exam exercises are best, especially if you don't have the time."
1,"Other comments said that this towel was fluffy and not like the picture, but for the price it is great. Yes, it is not cruel, but as long as you are sure it is in place when you put your child in his seat, you are lucky. I am sure this will be invaluable in the future for the new car seat we purchased. I learned that the lesson should be washed, washed and washed as a result of leaking diapers."

1,"At Christmas, I asked for a red bike for my bike-loving daughter, red is her favorite color ... expensive electronic motorcycles, and at the age of four she didn't need such a complicated and expensive game. After opening it, with great enthusiasm, it was very easy to install; All that is needed is a hammer and a screwdriver.

Since it was assembled, my daughter has been riding it almost non-stop from room to room as she spends her days. """

1,"Very easy tips: This motorbike looks great in the photos, the tips and instructions for using it are very easy but the stickers are not included in the package. A child cannot ride very quickly without turning over. I do not recommend this product to anyone"
1,"Fun game for children of all ages, this game is very fun and really nice. They look sturdy, sturdy and well-made, easy to assemble. The only problem is that although my son is over two years old, he prefers to push the game rather than ride it."
1,"Kids love this thing !: My 16 month old son loves playing this game. We went to the play center he had, and this was the only game that he kept hanging on to and playing with. He played with her for 45 consecutive minutes which is quite amazing for 16 months old. I definitely recommend it because it made my little son totally enjoy."

I always use his books."
1,"Emphasizing beginners: This book is good for beginners, although there are other books that are better than it."

1,"Clean, clean, clean! A lot of this washing powder removes all dirt, dishes have never looked this clean before. It cleans well. The extra cleaning of the ball seems to chew on anything stuck nicely."
1,"A very pleasant surprise: You took a risk and bought this album. The entire album turned out to be very good, and I'm very happy with it. Good attractive chants all the time. Are many people buying complete albums today ?? No . Rather, they download a song or two. In my opinion this is a shame . The album should be purchased in full"

1,"This bag may be useful for school children. Probably not recommended for laptop. Inappropriately designed for office use. Narrow at the top so that if you want to carry the document, it will fold at the top. There is no section for a bottle of water.

0,"HD DVD Player This new technology is the last puzzle to get the perfect home theater experience. The first is the sound and now the picture. I think this player is very powerful, even if your HD TV is small you will still enjoy the picture you will get and the bad thing about this player is the remote control. This is not an ordinary DVD player, it is closer to the computer. Last comment: It is very easy to set it up. I hope you enjoy it either now or later. """
0,The power strip is a good item for travelers but is useless if it cannot protect your equipment. The most important thing to consider low voltage ratings. Make sure you do your homework before purchasing any type of surge protector.
0,"Do not read this book, it was a terrible book. I felt bored to death with plot clues and plot, and I think this is a waste of time book. Even the parts describing the battles were boring. Along with all of my colleagues, this book was a waste of time. If possible, I would not give this book any stars at all. Don't waste your time, read another book. """
0,"I read this third grade. I thought it was okay. I am now in eighth grade. Reading is required. OK. I didn't remember much of it from the third grade, so I read it again. I was horrified by the simplicity of the book. Does not make sense. The setting is boring. I hated it. Some less mature people may enjoy it, not worth it."
0,Worst book i've ever read! It should be burnt!!!: This book was very boring and didnt keep me interested at all. I had to read it for school and do a bunch of crappy projects over this pointless book. This book should be torched.
0,"Unlike most books, this book started and was interesting from the start. The end (or mostly the second half of this book) was boring, stupid, lifeless, mysterious. I forced myself to finish it and found myself asleep. If the start of this book is not very good, then I would give this book a one-star rating, and it's not even worth it. For those looking for a historical fantasy wrapped in drama and excitement, you won't find it here"
0,"The plot and sequence of events were good, but the book in general was boring and disappointing! . I will not read it, but my teacher urges me to read it. If you are the type to love historical stories, this is your book. I just don't care about him that much"
0,"A very boring book, it tells the story of a struggling young man who has a relationship with a rich and powerful family, gets into a lot of trouble, and then experiences a death accident. I think this is a good book if you are not forced to read it as it is with me. Otherwise, it is actually a good book to learn. I do not recommend it to those who love comic books or fiction, because there is no comedy and is based on actual events. """
0,"This book is not worth a penny: This book, Johnny Tremain, really is a boring book. It has no sense whatsoever. DOn't read it if you don't have to"""
0,"I had to read, or tried to read, this book for school and it was terrible! It is one of the slowest books I've ever read. It took me ten minutes to read one page that I can usually read in two pages. In other words, it does not read quickly. I was not the only one of my colleagues who couldn't stand it. Six of us read the book, six of us hated it."
0,"This book was the most boring book on earth. I started reading it, and I couldn't even get to the part where the hero gets the molten silver!

0,"I read this book as one of the duties of language arts course. Last year, we watched the movie, and it was an interesting movie. I thought this would be a fun book to read, but now that I've read it, I don't really like it. Boring, but there are some interesting parts, like the tea party. If I were feeling generous tonight, I would have given this book two stars, because of the few exciting parts, but I would only give it one star ... ”"
0,"Read it only if you need sleep assistance! No one needs sleep medications at night anymore! You can only take a copy of this book and you will sleep in a short time! No plot, boring characters,!

0,"Yeast flakes: I am not sure what to do with these things ... they do not work well on popcorn. They do not dissolve in hot water, which makes me unable to use them with broth. I didn't like it and I probably won't buy it again."
0,"Very strange, but interesting, this movie is definitely not for children. Its start is somewhat disgusting, but the rest of the movie is great. His story is really cool, and if you're a fan of action movies, this movie is for you."
0,"When I bought this action movie, I thought it was good. After I finished watching it, I realized this was one of the best animations I've watched in a while. The only reason not to give it 5 stars is that it only took an hour and it could have been much better in two hours."
0,"Disappointing: No matter what I read here, I think this movie is not as expected. Graphic art is very poor, and the storytelling is very bad. Anyone who loves pictures will find it disappointing. I do not recommend this movie. Do not waste your money."

0,"Really bad comedy: The acting was bad, especially those supporting characters. The plot was ridiculous. The low-budget special effects were silly, and not in a good way. In short, don't waste your money on this bad smell. """
0,"Disappointing: a weak story, the characters were neither interesting nor attractive, couldn’t we do better? """
0,"Not exactly what I expected: I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine. From the description of the movie I thought it would be fun and funny. Well, the film was tacky to say the least. The special effects were not at all good. There was nothing to watch."
0,"Disappointing: I was expecting a lot more humor. Actually, the last 5 minutes is the funniest and only made me grin."""
0,"This video is a poor recording of the artist's comedic talent both artistically and professionally. The theater group looks drab and poorly lit, just like an amateur does at his first opportunity to record finger puppets for kindergarten class. . His comedy looks improvised. I think there are much better recordings for this artist."
0,"Very disappointed: I bought this book with great expectations. It was richly filmed with rare photographs of old aircraft. Writing and research were excellent, but I was immorally surprised. I returned the book to get a refund."

0,boring: If you like this album you will probably like any other mediocre band out there now. It is the same recycled music over and over. . Just my opinion.
0,"I thought this would only add flavor instead of this sweet aftertaste. I don't like sugar in my coffee. . I used to be such a product to add flavor only, not to contain all artificial sweeteners. Something is not good for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee, but if you do, it is good."
0,BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....

0,"I was so looking forward to this game being released, I was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date. Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it's release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven't felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another gameWhat a boost this could have been for you."
0,I found this book very confusing. The plot and plot are so elaborate that it is difficult to understand the content in the middle of the book. A good book but not one of my favorite books in any way.

0,"This camera ?? Sold at the retailer ???: I hope I can rate this camera (zero star). What I really hope is to put all these cameras in a pile and burn them. Very cheap bad quality buttons, blurry, blurry pictures. This is the worst camera I've ever used. Live and learn, and never buy anything this company has built."
0,"lousy, outdated guide, with horrible printing flaws!: First thing I noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together.. There were many pages that had to be hand cut just to TURN them. I could not stand the ... design. Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications."
0,Disappointed: This bag is not strong. It is like other bags that I have suffered from before. It is also more difficult to close.
0,Not ready for prime time: great technology packed into a mini machine that spins around you and cleans the floor. The problem is that it didn't last long for me. I mainly used it to clean the bathroom floor and under the furniture. The problem is that its charge (charger) does not last long.
0,"Initially I thought this vacuum cleaner would be very useful, but turned out to be more frustrating than a useful device. It performs very poorly on carpet-covered areas, and the front wheel stumbles pet hair quickly. I found myself spending more time cleaning this broom than using it. We quickly stopped using it to clean rooms and we only use it to clean under the bed."
0,"This product is not useful for removing old wallpaper. It could damage the bottom wall layer. Maybe it will work fine to remove more recent wallpapers, but if you have multiple layers of wallpaper in an old house, i would recommend liquid wallpaper remover instead."
0,"I am not impressed by this device, there was nothing special or special about this device. I can do the same amount of work doing this machine with a cloth with soap and water. I think it is not useless, but not worth spending money. I expected something amazing."
0,Be careful not to open this toner cartridge for installation in the printer. I discovered that it has arrived more than two years after its expiration date. HP excludes all warranties and service if it is installed out of date. This product was sold incorrectly by the seller and does not deserve any stars.

However, when opening the box, I saw that one of the columns is broken in this device. It was of poor quality.

No one likes to waste time charging broken devices back and forth."

I thought the DVDs were scratched, but I recently realized that this DVD player warms up and stops with almost all DVDs.

0,"Disappointed!: I bought this knife one week ago. On the first use itself, I didn't find the tip sharp enough, and the most serious problem was with the handle. The handle is very soft and it is very difficult to get a good grip while cutting. I decided to return this knife."
0,"The slicing machine that I bought was broken during shipping, and I never used it, the time set for receiving the replacement is too far. I  have canceled the order."

0,"really disappointed: I was so excited when I ordered this power strip and got it in time to take on vacation. The main problem is that the cord is TOO SHORT. I expected the cord to expand beyond the 5 inches you see on the surface. When you plug it in the wall, it doesn't come anywhere near the table top, so all of your appliances end up on the floor. I'm planning to return it and look for one with a longer cord."""
0,"The book started well, but in the second chapter I lost interest and interest in it. I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters were poorly developed and romance was almost non-existent. This book is not worth buying.

0,"This movie  might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience."
0,Not as expected...: My children get easily bored with this video.. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
0,"Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
0,I had to return the device twice because one of the poles in it was broken. It was shipped in original box without protection. This product should be shipped in two boxes. I have no problems with amazon customer service that was very good but they should find a better shipping company for this product.

0,"Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge., so look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power."
0,"Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes."
0,"Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the ""ON"" button, but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the ""OFF"" to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons, to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement), but in the end it was too flaky. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent, reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer."
0,"I have a bag with an inner pad and I have successfully used it with my laptop now for 3 years. On first use of this bag, the screen cracked severely. Whatever others say, this bag is definitely cheaper than many, but it doesn't provide the best protection for a long time."

0,A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.

0,"Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure, back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. On the other hand, meteorologists seem to do quite well."

The story is exciting and exciting, and it fits with the historical events that happened at the time of the story. This is a great book for all ages. """
1,"The way it is done Character description by the author, make you feel really there. In fact, I feel like this book is a window into the past that I can climb on. In this book you will love the main character being a brilliant and somewhat arrogant goldsmith jeweler. The only part of the book that I found disappointing is that the book is too short! If you love books that contain a bunch of excitement, a little romance, some suspense and a lot of history, then this book is for you."

1,"One of my best stories. I was really touched by the cutest story, visuals, pictures and sequence of everything. I caught my attention. I really like the idea that one of the creators would tear apart his human soul and his darker half, and how it was in his nature to try to save his friends from the virus."

1,Great Help: I ??think this program is help because you can learn more languages. It is important to know other languages ??in the business field so that you can speak to all clients.
1,"It tastes great !: Being vegetarian and nutritious, this yeast is a great way to get nutrients. This product tastes great! I put it on pasta, potatoes and vegetables - it's a great spice and it has a cheese flavor. I highly recommend it! """

1,Very good flavor: hazelnut flavor is very good but can be stronger. I have already added a bit of it to the coffee blend. Good smell and delicious delicious taste
1,Taste Great: This is really nice to have when you just want something a little different. It makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary.

I wish I had discovered it a long time ago but I am very happy that I have discovered it now.

1,"More please: I bought this product for the first time in about three months because of my passion for it. Love it, love it, love it I love it on popcorn, I desire it on spaghetti (with a touch of cheese). I eat spaghetti at lunch maybe four to five times a week now (without sauce). I don't know whether this is good or bad. But I feel relieved that this product is full of nutrients. I don't know how it compares to other brands. I bought this brand first and it tastes great to me, plus the price is cheaper than others."
1,A Dream Trip to Alaska: A Wonderful Picture Sequence and Video! . The author clearly has a deep love and respect for wildlife and a wild Alaskan neighborhood that he takes pictures with great experience in the video. It narrates Alaskan breathtaking wonders in a personal way. I believe the video can stimulate the interest and imagination of viewers of all ages.

1,"I have read some comments complaining about the breakdown of the extension wires after only a few months of use, so I decided to let you all know that after almost three years of use, my connecting wires work just as they did on the first day. It's cheap, and you do what you're supposed to do, and you never let me down. I bought it with confidence."
1,"It works according to desire: not perfect to that degree, but it is reliable, and frankly it is great and effective for me. That's all i want ."
1,one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
1,"I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation."
1,"Great CD:. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain.. One of life's hidden gems.. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?"""
1,"wish i had gotten this sooner!: ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. I have been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk, shelf, etc."
1,"I have used this product for about 10 years and about 6 vehicles. It has helped to keep the vehicle from rusting. It also helps to loosen and remove screws with ease. It works great, there are no problems, and the only thing to be aware of is that it lasts for three seasons. It is a product worth the price, excellent, great, worth it."
1,"Not as good as the other books, but it's good enough. It's an interesting and easy-to-read book about the 30-year-old ancient Greek Civil War that was so devastating. It is unfortunate that the author dies before he can complete the work in this book."
0,"Bad customer service !: My problem is not in the product, my main problem is in online orders and customer service. First, they listed the product as ""available"" while in fact ""stock ran out."" Send me an email to tell me that it will take them 5 to 7 more days to get the order and then send it to me..God - one person can't be your primary contact until they know the whole story. I finally received my shipment 3 weeks after placing my order. Would I buy them again, no! Look for another seller who understands what good customer service is."
1,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed this CD: I had to play this CD several times since I first got it, because I needed to confirm what I heard. These chants resonate with me deeply. I am still amazed at how close my feelings are to these songs. It is wonderful to hear what is expressed in me harmoniously."
1,"Well made gate. Very easy to install. Ergonomic handles, with an efficient design, makes it easy to open and close"
1,"Beautiful pictures, great strings, somewhat boring designs: I just got this sewing book for my birthday, and I was excited about it, because at first glance the book looks beautiful, and the shirt designs look rational and comfortable. In fact I looked at models and instructions, instructions are frequent in most designs."
1,"Wonderful Collection: This set of DVD is a great collection that can be obtained if your child loves this cartoon character. It's a great gift too! And for the price, 3 DVDs are definitely worth it."
1,"I like the Rumba wireless broom !! It is wonderful and comfortable. I am very surprised by the ability of this small machine to pick up small parts of various wood floors, tiles, weak carpets and thick carpets, and it works on all of them. It picks up very fine dirt and dust. If you buy, be sure to take good care of it and always empty the dirt."
1,Very beautiful bowl for baking cakes and biscuits. Easy to clean. Size is beautifully fit - not big or small.
1,5-piece oak dining set: it's a beautiful set just to put together. Instructions for installing chairs are somewhat difficult and the rest is easy.
1,"The rumba broom is smart and can be useful during the warranty period but after that it is basically disposable tools. This is due to the lack of spare parts. Five stars during the warranty period, one star after that."
1,"Integrity and honesty: I received the game in a short period of time, the game does not work on my screen .. I wrote to the company that I bought it from, and they were very understanding, and returned my money ... I will buy from them again, because they did not even question my integrity, or my honesty."
1,"Great purchase for a great product, great for cleaning your kitchen stove and oven from fat, grease and dirt accumulated. I am very pleased with this product."
1,"Great device, great price: I bought this steamer. Until now, I cleaned all the tiles in the bathroom, and we also cleaned all the walls with steam in preparation for a new paint job. This is a great device with good accessories! You can use this device for only one hour at a time, but in all honesty, your arms tire after an hour anyway. This product is highly recommended for all mothers who are looking for a safer way to clean without harsh chemicals."
1,Stylish little film - not for children: a good and surprising scenario. Fun to watch. But the fighting scenes will not be suitable for young viewers.
1,"I bought this book shortly after its release, and I am still using it to this day. I've learned that you don't need 20 different solutions to clean the house. For cleaning, I learned to use vinegar and baking soda. It is a time saving, and money saving. It is a useful and useful book on green life."
1,The item is not properly packed and broken in shipping. Unable to get any response from the seller! I had to call Amazon directly. Excellent deal and great customer service.
1,"Try one of the recipes in the accompanying cookbook, as well as mix the cakes from the supermarket. I used self-raising flour. Either way, the cake didn't swell and the cake didn't rise, I was very disappointed."

1,It is a wonderful and excellent book of wisdom and common sense for those who have lost their minds in daily life.
1,"A fairly technical and interesting book on fossil birds: The author does a great job in presenting a good overview of the evolution of birds in general and fossil birds in particular, many illustrations and comprehensive references. Although everyone may disagree with the author's point of view, this is still useful in the evolution of birds and fossil bird species."
1,"I finally got a proper device after returning two damaged devices. The problem was neither the shipment of the goods nor the method of packaging. Rather, the problem is to compensate for the hardware damage, I must praise Amazon for this and responding very well. I finally got an undamaged device yesterday and after one test we found it to work as expected. It is very well made and easy to use."
1,"This device works great from the start - easy to setup, maybe 30 minutes. The machine contains 4 chisels. I paid $ 200 for this free shipping. Great value. It arrived in perfect condition with all parts included. Well packed in a huge carton lined with premium preservative."
1,"A great tool to add to your store: This machine has been received in perfect condition. Working well as it should. It's a great."""
1,"I received this machine in defective condition, the box was completely crushed. The machine had large, dangerous cracks and had to be returned. Amazon was very good to replace it. But there was a lot of trouble. Next time see the instructions and comments for each device when purchasing it."
1,"It was a great movie, a romantic comedy, the acting was pretty good, although actors and actresses with a secondary role were better than the main characters. Although the plot of events in the movie was not good, I recommend it to watch even once"
1,"Wonderful movie, I feel comfortableWhile watching it. The characters of this movie grow and grow. But when they realize that they have grown up, they begin to approach each other without realizing it! A really cool movie."
1,Wow: This book provides really good basic knowledge of how to make hats. Without any experience I can follow clear instructions and make a great hat myself. Clear pictures and enough examples to get started and create your own design.
1,Wonderful Book!: This book is out of print so I was so glad to find a copy here at such a good price. It's very informative and shows many different projects.
1,"A beautiful, slim and stylish bag that fits your 16-17 inch laptop too."
1,"Good design and durable material: I received the laptop bag in record time and the shipping was free, great start! The bag is sturdy, lightweight and looks elegant. There is a small outer bag that snugly fits the power cord and a set of headphones. Overall, a great product for half the price."
1,"A fun and enjoyable book to read with romance, intrigues and strength all the time. I am glad that the heroine evolved into a strong woman. Some of the plots in this book seemed predictable and made me attracted to it. A book that you can make a wonderful movie from."
1,"The writings of this author are very ingenious, I prefer her modern puzzles over her historical romantic stories. This book is full of character building and suspense."
1,Great knives. Top quality. I have a whole bunch and they are the best cutlery I've ever used.
1,"Love this bag, what an excellent purchase. I really enjoyed using this bag. It is strong and soft, and its shape is very suitable for the extreme."
1,Nutcracker movie: This movie is great. I have been looking for this version for a number of years. I am so glad Amazon had this one.
1,"A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other ""Woman against the odds"" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's ""Shelters of Stone""."
1,Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice Sony!
1,No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
1,"I really enjoyed this book because the author uses a great description when writing about characters and scenery. The end is fun. I love this book so much, it is fun."
1,"Excellent camera, easy to use, great battery life :. I bought this camera for $ 300 and have been happy since then. The camera chooses the best settings for your surroundings. You can only use manual controls that I use some of the time. The flash is a little slow, and it takes about two seconds to flash and take the picture. This camera takes great pictures, and when I show them to people, they are surprised and ask me what kind of camera. """
1,What a classic movie! Best version of this movie. I liked this release. This choreography is very beautiful. The only reason not to give him 5 stars is the fact that there is no search feature for any part of the movie. I still love it
1,"If you read this book, you will need to plant a tree in your backyard! This book contains a great deal of information about the trees of some fruits and explained in an easy way how to use a tree to benefit you and the health of your loved ones. Almost every chapter describes a new way to use the tree, especially the juice. I have read the book twice for the first few days - I highly recommend it."
1,"Enchanting book of truth and herbal wisdom. The author is naturally able to make in writing a particular character that binds us to ourselves and brings us closer to our Creator. All in the context of solid, easy-to-use, and unique information."
1,"Comprehensive information, I can highly recommend this book to any distributor, publisher and reader, because it is a powerful source of proof and arguments."
1,"It's a very good case for keeping your laptop, but it's a little too big for your laptop. It has a great side pocket for storing things and seems to keep everything nice and safe."
1,"Wonderful cookbook !: One of the best things that happened to me as a chef was the discovery of a pressure cook. I serve these dishes regularly to guests and almost all of them love them. Cooking is in a short time. This cookbook was individually responsible for purchasing 3 pressure cookers, and I highly recommend it."
1,"When I received this product, my nails needed some attention due to the extra work I did on my new home. The tools were very easy to use, and their shape makes them easy to hold. It did very well to remove stains on my nails. I definitely recommend this product to others."
1,Liked it: great little device. Small enough. The wire can be longer. Maybe they could create a retractable cord with the following model.
1,Perfect: it works great! It is a small and light energy chip. Ideal for traveling and around the home. Well built and works well.
1,I have now made some progress here. The questions are excellent and doing this job is of an educational type. I haven't read the last half of the book yet.
1,"I am a fan of this boxer, and I really enjoyed this DVD, it's interesting, really good. """
0,"Interesting but very confusing article: good article. However, the layout is very confusing. I could only understand it after reading it 3 times."
0,"Healthy but not tasty: I tried to take this strip of sweetness as healthy and natural, but apparently not right for me. It tastes like bitter metal. I can eat this if necessary but it is really unpleasant. I highly suggest trying one strip before purchasing a set from it. good luck! It should never be eaten."
0,"Big disappointment: I am a big fan of these previous producers' films. It is good to see actors from previous films in new roles. The film is superficial, and the concept it contains is absurd, but the acting is nice. One painfully realizes that one is watching a bad movie."
0,"This movie could have worked well but failed on many levels, the acting is boring, and the scenario is mindless."
0,Very upset: I ordered this product two months ago and haven't received it yet. I sent an email to the company and did not receive a response. I will never buy anything from these people again.
0,"Beautiful prose and wonderful characters: It is unfortunate that the author forgot to write a story. The premise is great, writing is great. But the characters are so sterile that I don't even care about them. This book reminds me of the soft crystal. Sharp, beautiful but cool in the end without meaning."
0,"Disappointing: I was very disappointed. It is very small, and the texture quality is very low. It wasn't even good for viewing, like the game. I will not buy it again"
0,"These people are not fit to be parents. There are very disgusting things that they do to their children, and they make them look terrible. Something really unfortunate."
0,"I had a knife for years until it broke. It was a very good knife and I was using it so much that I decided to buy another one. I bought the knife and tried to take it apart to remove the blade and clean it but I couldn't even open it. This stainless steel knife is not really stainless steel. I realized this when I hold my magnet in my toolbox, I couldn't be more disappointed with this purchase."
0,"Typos and more: In addition to the many typos and grammatical errors in this book, I wonder if all the pictures are really from the cities mentioned. The title of the book is very interesting which made me look at it in the local library. I advise you not to buy this book and save your money in other things."
0,"Do not trust the information: Upon arrival at a hotel described as ""good"" and ""luxurious"". Then we found it dirty, moldy, and in terrible repair. We could not stay a second night as we had planned."
0,"Very frustrating: the book can be fully condensed into a 20-page booklet if you remove all extra line spacing, etc. They (the authors) need to start giving readers more to each book. I was so disappointed that I would not continue to follow the series of these books. The book was full of excitement and marketing tricks."
0,"Once again disappointed: What is this book series about? . The first book was great - thought-provoking and a bit scary. Every book since then has been disappointing. With each new release, my doubts grow that the authors are greedy. Try to sell more books by extending the series."
0,"This whole series was terrible and awful, not readable. It talks about a person who meets someone, enters into a fight, escapes, meets another person, engages in combat, escapes, etc. In fact, this was shocking."
0,"This book is not very useful: I actually mastered some of the 2007 Office skills, and we bought this book if someone had a question that I couldn't answer. This book failed to answer many of our questions. I was very lucky to search in googl and get answers."
0,"Bad taste is required for all natural toothpastes. I don't like this taste; however, I still use it occasionally."
0,Not so cool: these moving trays may be nice and fun but hard to push and move. I do not recommend them all.
0,"We bought this machine to promote a topic in the medical library. It is a flimsy game for practical use. It does not have the ability to capture anything larger than a crystal piece, the battery life is very short."
0,"Bad Spanish Program: I am a teacher and I intend to use this program to learn Spanish. Based on simulation. The teaching method used here is centered on the content and not the student, the student is subject to conditions, and none of the activities are displayed in any context."
0,The retailer sent the wrong product. There is no way to replace. I wouldn't order from amazon again.
0,"I wish I didn't buy this game, it's awful !!! My daughter hasn't played with it yet and it's already broken. He broke one of the pegs that held the entire game while my husband was installing it. I will not spend my money on this game. I expected this game to be of better quality. For all parents who are considering purchasing this game, I would like to tell you that its quality is not worth the price."
0,"This phone is not good !!!!: I bought this phone a few days ago, and all you get is echo, buzz, and lots of annoying noises from it."
0,"Dear buyer, be careful, as some food products you buy may be old or have a small hole in the package that dries the contents."
0,"I heard about and loved these games - well, I decided to try these games because my daughter is pressing for it. What a piece of junk - it's badly made, it didn't last for two weeks. Thinking about returning it to the store you bought it from."
0,"Frankly, I thought this book would be a good book in my kitchen. It turns out that the information in the book can be found anywhere on the Internet. I hated most recipes as they contained unfamiliar ingredients. I ended up donating this book to the local public library. I know someone will find it useful."
0,"Playing this game is an average thing for me, I was expecting something more interesting, and instead I get a game with frequent playing style. It is not a terrible game, there is nothing innovative enough to impress me."
0,"This book should be the absolute worst that I have read in my entire life.I reached the tenth page and started yawning, and by page 20, I decided that burning is the best use of this book. Not worth $ 5 to ship it up."
0,Not very good: When I got this game I thought it would be great but it was easy to catch balls and that's all I have to say.
0,This dryer takes 3 times the time to dry the hair with another dryer. The cord expands greatly. I wouldn't recommend this dryer to anyone. It is very bad.
0,"Total waste of time and money: I will never buy any other product from this store. The instructions given about this adapter are completely useless. Although it is written all over the box that ""It does not need holes and nails to fix it"", you discover when you try to install it that in reality you must drill nails into plastic pieces without pre-prepared holes! Unfortunately, I can't return this product and will have to throw it in the Trash Can. Awesome company and terrible product."
0,It took 21 days to receive my parcel - when the parcel came out was empty. Tricked Postal Service - anyway I couldn't listen to my disk.
0,"The seller itself was really very nice but the product is defective. Immediately sent a new product, which was awesome, but the second product (DVD) did not work on my computers. It was a waste purchase for money."
0,"A very cheap game, but it is useless and difficult, if you leave it on the ground, it will end up under the nearest furniture, or slip under the feet, which sometimes causes broken feet"
0,"Don't buy this game, it's a waste of money and time !!!: My daughter wanted this game months ago before I finally gave up and bought it for her. She was very excited. We got home and played for an hour hoping for something different or better to happen. The game was very boring. Barbie does everything perfectly whether she does it or not. My daughter has not played it since and she is very disappointed in it. The store I purchased from will not allow me to return it because it was opened. They will allow me to exchange it with the exact same game and that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money."
0,"A complete waste: My daughter received this Christmas CD. It is very slow to load a lot of waiting time for things to happen. . I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use it. I would recommend saving your money and getting something of value"
0,"I bought this air mattress, I used it only 3 times and now it's losing air !! How can it leak air with only 3 uses ?? At first, it looks fine because it is comfortable and long, but now I can't use it unless I fill it with air in the middle of the night."
0,"Electric pump failure: It was transferred to France and the electric pump worked for only a minute and it exploded. I bought a hand pump to inflatable the bed. It was a painful task. After it was completely inflated the bed was somewhat comfortable. I decided not to go home because, once inflated, there would be no way to shrink to the extent that would fit into the original box."
0,"Misleading picture: There was little information about the product other than the picture. No price is too good but don't be fooled. They charge a lot for shipping, the parcel arrived in time, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legal supplier."
0,"Waste of money: If you get to this comment about this toy, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to . A watse of money!"
0,"What a waste !: an hour after trying to assemble the tower, we surrendered. The legs continued to fall, causing the tower to fall. This was a big disappointment. We brought back the game the next day in pieces."
0,"Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story: Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them."
0,"A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose."
0,"We think the book had a huge impact on our English because it contained a very difficult language so we had to search for words all the time in the dictionary and this way we learn two things, search for words in the dictionary and new words, we liked the end when all the main characters died. You left a great message."
0,"Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version."
0,"It always amazes me how some outside sellers are trying to manipulate consumers with their expensive merchandise here. You can bet that I won't buy anything from this seller, even if it's a big deal, and that's a very high price. Why would someone pay more than that online? Beware, buyer."
0,"I had to try to sleep on it on the first night - in a few hours it was less solid, which made it difficult to roll it. It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake, so it will be very difficult to return it because it is almost impossible to reinstall it in its original box (because one cannot empty all of the remaining air needed to make it fold)."
0,"We used this for less than 21 days for the guest. She does everything as advertised but she starts leaking air; As she woke up in the morning, she shrunk to less than half her bloated height. There is a set of instructions to correct the problem but we could not find the air exit place. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single foldable bed instead with a sponge mattress, uncompressed but less dangerous than an air mattress."
0,Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
0,"Simply a waste of time: this book was a preacher, simpler, and boring and not helpful. It was neither motivational nor informational but was a waste of money and time."
0,"Not a true solution: I didn't find this method any different than the cry it out method. After all, you are just leaving your baby to cry in his crib...though the authors suggest only allowing so for an hour at naptime. Well, after an hour of sobbing uncontrollably, my baby could NOT get to sleep, and I was heartbroken that I even attempted this. There are gentler ways to help your baby sleep."
0,"I was a little disappointed with this new version. Beach background and music were distracting and the exercises weren't as well designed as on other DVDs. . In general, I feel healthier, happier and sleep better, so I love myself better. My favorite DVDs are those for weight loss, great feeling, yoga, and body beauty"
0,"A few lost cities and a lot of garbage: I read this in search of more information on different sites but I was very disappointed. There are some descriptions of several sites along with lots of guesses and questionable history. Sorry, it is a waste of time and money."
0,"Not properly packed - Cannot be used: This trolley comes without any protective packaging (it is sent in a cardboard box that fits the folded trolley perfectly - there is no filling, no protective layer, not even any strong cardboard corners to prevent the fragile box from collapsing ), So of course they are protected when they arrive and you cannot use them. If it had arrived in good condition, it would have been a decent cart."
0,Hook (hook) on the door in black: I'm not very happy with it because I didn't know it was a thick door and my door wasn't thick so I had to adjust it but it didn't look the way it would be. I feel the seller had to mention it as a thick door.
0,This book is more  than an informative look into the microsoft case. Poor writing and questionable facts make this book impossible to read. Save your money!
0,Disappointment: I am very disappointed with this program. It shatters and seems very slow. I was expecting much better from a product that cost a lot. I have to get my work done and I don't have to be constantly frustrated with the way the software falters.
0,"Great movie, not great DVD: It's interesting that this movie goes beyond the usual sweet love story. The movie depicts the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face, I'll give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for DVD quality. Sure split into parts, the image isn't the best in quality. It can still be viewed, and I won't take it back, but I wish the photo was a little better."
0,"My kids and I love little creature books. A great book, but it didn't quite hold up well. The book fell off the cover within a few days of receiving it."
0,"This book was a huge disappointment. It may have been a special spark to make this author's books something special, but I found that the book contained little movement, romance, and less ambiguity. Uninteresting book. I will definitely not pass it on to my friends and family to read it."
0,"Very boring: this book had a lot of potential it didn't like. This book required a lot more action and a lot of editing, it was a very long time for the amount of plot it contains."
0,"I could never stand this book, I just don't understand how sexy it is for a woman to give up on her friends and life to a man who wants to completely control it. The heroine is gorgeous at first, but eventually turns into a submissive wife. It's so sad for a woman to leave her old life behind."
0,Frustrated: I was really disappointed with this book. Other books the author wrote were very good but that was boring. It was as if she was rushing to release a new book and not taking the time to make it fun. I am still reading the other books that you write but I will never read this book again.
0,"When I read this author's first book, it was an excellent read and it made me addicted to the entire series! I thought the other book would be the same, but I discovered it was a boring book. Before I got to the middle of it, I didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were lagging behind and the main characters were 2D. Nor did I feel the time or place. In short, it looked like the plot of a short story that had been expanded to capitalize on its success. Author please do not write anything like this."
0,"Low resolution and poor quality: I bought it new, the color is very good, the resolution is very poor, only a close-up shot makes you feel full. Other than that you sometimes get a blurry and distorted edge. I didn't use it much for the first 3 years, only the last two years I used it regularly to record my daughter's piano class assignments every two weeks for 5-8 minutes at a time. Recently I had to hit this camera hard a few times to start recording (it's a common problem as my piano teacher told me). So I have to find a new video camera now. I don't know what to do if I refuse to work one day in my daughter's piano class."
0,"This book was difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost at the end. But the author is a great writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing."
0,"Equation Formula Writing: I enjoyed it, so I bought several other works from this writer. But I was a little disappointed to find that all of her books had the same formulation and character studies. After a while, reading her works becomes less exciting. Become frivolous."
0,"I must say I was required to read this book to the class. If not, I would have put the book in the middle of the road. I was influenced by the huge amount of technical language and graphic descriptions. Honestly, I was very disappointed with this book."
0,"I think it was a mystery: her writing style made me unable to appreciate the story behind her and as a result, I found it blank and inauthentic. So much so, that I felt compelled to come write a comment for this book so that others would avoid making the same mistake I did."
0,"Too Scattered, Too Shallow: Although this might be a good book for introducing technical writing issues to someone considering this area, it is not helpful if you want detailed information. The information it contains varies greatly in depth. If you are already involved in technical writing, there are even better books."
0,"Totally Unfunny: When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say """"What on earth is this?..."""" but we decided to give it a chance and let it play - for about half an hour before we couldn't bare to watch any more. The title says 'Funny' - it wasn't. The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film - but it was in no way funny at all. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing."
0,Dirty people! Wicked movie !: Entertainment in places that are spoiled by a lot of rude and dirty talk that demean women. In the end I found nothing mentioned or funny in this movie. It is sad that such an actor appeared in such a frivolous movie.
0,"Long and somewhat boring, this isn't a typical movie, and it isn't necessarily a bad thing. First of all, this is not funny. It's about ""comedy"" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself a comedy, although there are some funny things about it. Its runtime is long but it doesn't actually achieve much. Some people might like the story, but it was just too boring for me."
0,"Not what I expected: seriously I wasn't expecting a dramatic look in the mind of a comedian. When I hired this movie, I expected a lot of humor with so many funny actors. My wife and I were so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch TV much, but when I watch something I want it to be of value, if you like these artistic movies about the serious life of people in the spotlight, you will love this movie. And if you are looking for humor, you can forget it, I give this movie one star because this is not my type of movie and it was advertised as a great comedy not a drama."
0,"I could not give him less than one star .... Or I would have: There is not much to say about this movie ... I am a huge fan of this actor and I love him in everything. But this movie was very long and loud !!! The comedies in the movie were not funny ... at all .... I paid to watch it, and I hope for my money back."
0,Absolutely NOTHING Funny !: This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"The worst movie I've ever seen: This movie was horrible! I don't know how anyone could give it 5 stars. This movie was the worst two hours of my life. It felt like I was watching two movies at once. Anytime someone asks me about this movie, I tell him it's a waste and that I rent something else."
0,"The longest movie ever: It's supposed to be funny. But this was not the case. This movie has a lot of potential, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 films of it, of two and a half hours long. Very long. A little bit of humor. The only good thing about it was all the big stars in it, which is probably the reason why this movie made it to the big screen and didn't move directly to DVD."
0,"Dirty movie, profanity. !!!: I can't believe that a clever actor like this author degrades himself by acting in a degenerate garbage movie like this, but I think money makes some people do things underneath it. This movie is as funny as Sewer, all it consists of is endless and meaningless profanity. If you have very few or no thinkers or are a decadent, trashy trash, then this movie will appeal to you."
0,"Stupid: Honestly, if you want to hear a lot of insults, you'll like it. Not to mention, the story line was ridiculous. I do not recommend!"
0,"I usually like this actor's movies but that was awful. None of them were done correctly, and the jokes were horribly stupid and had no meaning everywhere. Don't waste your time and money on this."
0,"A waste of time: I must say that I have never liked this author. There are a lot of talented people who never had a chance to appear on screen. I still don't understand what this actor is so special about, besides that I decided to give him a try. It took half an hour when I stopped watching."
0,Gloomy and boring: My husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. This will be a waste of your time
0,"Please run away from this movie: It's too long and totally aimless. Some might call it ""complicated,"" but I would call it foolish. There are few laughs here and there - but nothing will make it worth the wait. Even when one turns away from the fact that this was not intended to be a mere comedy but rather tries to address some more serious content it is still bad. Do not waste your money. Watch anything really entertaining. I wish someone warned me."
0,How can anyone smile with the kind of trash that this actor is doing? This guy is just a stupid redneck. Don't waste your money on it.
0,"Not funny: This is what some production companies call humor these days? It should be written by humble, unemployed writers while on strike! Rude, offensive and a waste of my time!"
0,"Pathetic People: New comedy stars make me miss real stars. Why not try to learn from the elderly, side note: This production company didn't create real comedy."
0,"Film Failure: This movie was not a base or original concept. The jokes were lame and so were the shows. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using these actors in the box office draw. Whereas, watching this movie in theater was not worth the money."
0,"There are actually no stars to rate this movie: This was one of the worst films I ever sat. In fact, I drifted away near the end and was grateful I didn't waste that time. Horrible and frightening."
1,"Very inspiring: You just saw funny people. For an all-star movie, it was an amazing movie. If you want to watch a movie full of laughter and a good story, then choose this movie. I promise you will not regret it."
0,"Not what it appears on the cover: As someone with an interest in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it up to find a wicked woman carrying insults that denigrate religion and show the religious as hypocrites, in a stereotypically flimsy way. It might be fun for others, but not fun for me. Not only is it inappropriate for kids, but there are plenty of adults who don't want to be upset with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity too. I wish I had a warning before trying to read this book."
0,"Scam, not as advertised: This DVD was titled “Contest.” It wasn't a contest, and it didn't even contain a winning performance. I consider it a complete fraud and a misrepresentation."
0,"This could be the worst novel I have ever read. There are many problems, including: 1) The main character is an unbearable personality and has no sense of humor. I had never read a novel where I hated the main character. 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is pretty ridiculous. I am amazed that this book has been published and placed on the bestseller list."
0,"No lessons learned: This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, apology."
0,"One Lesson Everyone Need to Learn !: As an economics student and teacher, this book has proven to be an invaluable resource! The lesson is simple and direct, but one that many people fail to implement. You cannot object to the main lessons from this book. It's fun to read, and it's especially easy for a book on economics. I highly recommend it! ''"
0,"Not worth the money: I was hoping for something that lasts all day and gives my lashes some of the thing I need well. I am blonde and my skin is thin and short. This didn't do the job. By the end of the day, I left a shadow below my lower lashes. This isn't the worst mascara I have ever used which is why I gave it 2 stars but it definitely isn't worth the high price."
0,"disappointed: The wig was true to color, but it tangled so quickly and was not brushable. Had to throw it out after a couple of wears."""
0,"Boring, useless: this book looks like a fashion magazine. There are loads of cool interesting photoshoots, but you won't gain anything significant by reading this. There is nothing new to learn here. There is not much to say about this book. It didn't teach me anything that I didn't know already, and I'm not sure why I wasted money and time on it."
0,"Not Recommended: I must admit being bored by this book. The writing was good but seemed very deliberate and rather overblown, irritating with name dropping, unnecessarily heavy on sex scenes, and an incredibly weak ending. I found myself nearly quitting several times thinking of all the other really good books waiting on my shelves. Instead it was one I could have not started and not missed."""
0,"What a disappointment: I bought this item as a gift and was embarrassed about the quality - the corner was damaged, and it had a horrible chemical smell. All in all a real problem, I don't want to have the hassle of returning the product . I have already spent enough. """
0,"bad quality game: i didn't like this toy at all ,,, very bad quality .. would not recommend it to anyone .. .."""
1,"I love fast drawing, this knife is great, useful, and at a great price, it helps me make some beautiful graphics."
1,"Very fun and educational !! I love this game! I bought it for my 15 month old son. Animal names are embroidered on them until children learn the word. Every animal makes its own sound, I thought this was nice in the picture, but it's better in real life. Animal details are great especially given their small size. Love her!!"""
1,"Great Album: Exelent album one step more in the evolution of this great group, it is  one of the best new band in prog rock"""
1,"We love this barn my two and a half year old daughter and we are always looking for portable mini games to take with us when traveling. Animals are not very small, great for not losing or losing pieces. Easily fits into the barn for storage and play. The best animals are written with names to learn and make noises !! We have a lot of fun with this game at home and when we're out. Thanks for the great product !!! """
1,"Fast service, very pretty and very comfortable. You really can wear this for 18 hours and feel quite comfort"
1,"I was thrilled when this concert became available on DVD. I saw a performance very similar to that in the early 1980's. The voice of the vocalists is excellent, the performance of the orchestra is very impressive. I think this is a perfect party and everyone should have it!"
1,Wonderful: Better than Season 1. A story written in a very creative way. The visuals and sound effects are amazing! 3D like pictures. I wait impatiently for the third season.
1,"Kids love watching this movie, and they want to watch it again and again. In my opinion, this is a great purchase."
1,"Amazing: This is honestly one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Specifically, I don't know what this album is talking about, but it gets stuck in my head and I enjoy its presence."
1,"Nice shoes but problem in sizes, I usually wear shoes size 13, and as such, I ordered size 13 for these shoes. The shoe arrived, but it was big, which I found strange, but the shoes themselves, I enjoy them. It looks pretty, wears easily, is comfortable. I wanted to replace it with a size 12, but it is out of stock. I will get my money back."
1,"Adorable!: My 4 month old loves this toy! She smiles at all the sounds and the different shapes of the animals are great for teaching her to grasp and hold. There are no small or dangerous parts. I believe this toy will have lasting appeal even once she's a toddler;. I would highly recommend this toy for even very young babies, and I plan to purchase some of the other sets in this line as well!"""
1,Very nice: this is a little barn with animals inside. All of them make their voice when pressed. It is really nice and easy to carry by a small child.
1,"Very nice product, i bought this item about a month ago and i found it so cute that i need to buy another product for my friend."
1,"Beautiful, wonderful collection of chants and unique sound. Buy it."
1,"I really like this knife, the only problem i have is the lock and unlock button. When fully opened, he must press the unlock button down to close the blade."
1,"Too lengthy: There is much valuable information in this book, but it takes far too much of a time commitment to follow it through and do the exercises."
1,"More geared towards people during adolescence: I was disappointed with the content of this book: Hard-hitting - the font size is too small - and too long because of this. If it were otherwise, I think parents would find it more helpful for their children. It explains how shyness and lack of self-esteem (thousands of adults suffer from both) relate to their causes and solutions."
1,See This Movie: This movie delivers a beautiful and simple song to the soul. Amazingly poignant performances
1,This tool helps me to easily put on and close the bracelet. Now I can wear my jewelry myself. Very easy to use. I love that.
1,"Great DVD: One of the best DVDs I've ever seen, if you like this actor, you'll be amazed ... advise you to buy it !!"
1,"Poor Production - Fair Performance: The lighting and camera work for this video is poor. The audio recording was good. I have mixed opinions on performance. The microphone was great. The actors are great, some of them very passionate."
1,"A great biography of the great heroic and mathematical poet of war: the biography brilliantly crafted with an entertaining balance between story and documentation. I found the level of detail surprising and absolutely unrestricted, the book expanded and deepened my appreciation of man, times, war, literary and cultural environment in the first two decades of Britain in the twentieth century."
1,"Great white seat !: I asked for a seat, arrived two days later, and is in great shape, and I'm happy with it. I don't like writing reviews, for me there is rarely anything I can say about any product I order. I ask, I receive, either I like it or not, and that's me. I appreciate what is written in the comments about the products, but I am not one of those writing it."
1,"I bought one of these five cool flashlights for my teenage daughter's room. We just love the thing, but it wasn't a good fit in the middle of the long tube. The strands were rough and barely enough to bear the weight of this light, well-made light. We brought the lamp back to the store and replaced it with another. The same. When you move this unit, do it very carefully, as it will break in the middle. I am still using it, but it's accurate. Weak design in one place."
1,"Best Lamp Ever! I have no idea how I lived 3 years of college without this lamp. Last year I got a lamp and it was really one of my best purchases! I owned it more than a year ago and I love it! It was hard to find a lamp that could illuminate the room enough, looked elegant, and matched to the unique needs of a college student. Perfect for studying and reading. The only complaint is that it is rather heavy. Worth more than what you paid for !!"
1,"This tool is great and great, but the paint is not good. My hands are completely covered with black oily matter that comes out of the tool as soon as I remove it from the box. It's pretty bad, looks nice, but it's clearly not designed to withstand even slight use."
1,"I have not had this book very long. However, it appears to be VERY helpful. I have never gone wrong buying  it."
1,"A very educational book, only 4 stars because I haven't fully completed the book yet, and I have nothing else to compare with it, so giving it 5 stars would be an ignorant rating, laughter."
1,I have bought many parenting books and found the information in this book somewhat limited and not very helpful. There are lots of other good education books that give better details than this book!
1,"Just right, it took me 10 minutes to install. The original Sony lamp lasted for more than 6 years. This device has a 180-day warranty. You only need to know how long it will stay."
1,"Wonderful service: To start off, I was very pleased with the price of this product. It was very reasonable considering that I had paid much more when buying from the actual vendor. The shipping was just as excellent. I was told it would take more than a week to receive my order, but it came the very next day (although I do live quite close to where they were shipping from). All in all, I am very pleased with this seller. Perfect service."
1,"We found the program easy to install and easy to retrieve lessons. Lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accommodate the learning method. The accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program. So far, we are happy with the materials and have felt so successful in learning some basic phrases."
1,I inherited these decorative trays from my mom and have never used them because they are decorated with gold. Very beautiful but you should use decorative silverware to go along with it. It is expensive but very beautiful. I will only use it for special occasions. I am very happy with it.
1,"My favorite all the time: I love this CD! Once I start listening to it, I can't stop. I have to listen to everything. All songs are unique and interesting."
1,"This only worked for a few months. If you look at the comments of other users, you will see this to be true for this type of watch. Stay away from it and don't buy it!"
1,"A nice introduction to proofreading: the book is easy to read for beginners. It is easy to understand and has a lot of information on the subject. Even if you don't plan to do it professionally, the book is very useful especially if you are dealing with a lot of documents and letters in your daily work. Encourages you to be more detail oriented. A very useful skill if you work as a manager, lawyer, secretary and more for students. Some parts are redundant and slightly excessive in use of proofread codes; But still an informative reading."
1,"Bodybuilding book: I really enjoyed this book. Although the book is almost 30 years old, fitness is a very important thing."
1,Have you just started ?: This is a great book for anyone who has just started with weight exercises. It contains all the basic procedures and activities.
1,"Quiet, reliable and easy to clean vacuum cleaner. All parts can be easily disassembled for total cleaning. It operates 24 hours per day in the summer."
1,"The Ice Block is nice in shape, but it's made out of weird material: I first loved it, but after keeping it in the freezer for a few weeks, the bottom became really fluffy. I think something is starting to dissolve in some way. It was important to think about what could happen in my ice cube, so I threw it away. I do not recommend this."
1,"Delicious: I found this book in a small olive oil store and fell in love with it immediately. It appears to have been supplied first in French, then translated into English as well, the book's content is very well presented and described, and covers all aspects of olive oil from its date of manufacture, to the main producing regions of the world and their characteristics. The second half of the book is for recipes related to olive oil. I was very satisfied with this purchase, but unfortunately, a price tag must be marked."
1,"Classic movie, very accurate. I was surprised by the quality of the DVD from it, the seller was fast and no problems !!!"
1,"I loved it, I bought this as a gift for my grandson - I definitely loved it - created a lot of fun - it was successful!"
1,"Yes Yes Yes yes Yes! It was a very good read and I cannot wait for the next release. Yes, this is an excellent book and will earn a place of honor in my personal library."
1,"Big blower, but it only works with electricity, it works great, but it consumes electricity greatly. . Unfortunately, it is electric. If you have to buy again, buy the type that works with gas."
1,Wonderful book !! I enjoyed it and it was so amazing. It is very easy to read as it makes you meditate the power of words. I have recommended this book to everyone.
1,great mattress: this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
1,Best Air Mattress Ever !!!: I love this Air Mattress so much. It is very easy to blow and empty quickly. It is very strong and durable as well. On the whole it is an excellent gift for anyone expecting to travel or even if you have many guests
1,Great find at a great price: I needed to replace the air mattress but I didn't want to spend the money. This one works well and was very economical compared to the one that I found in the bed shop.
1,"Better than a ""normal"" bed: I just moved out of my mom's house and I didn't want to bring a big bed with me so I got an air bed. It has been two months since I left and I still sleep on it. You can totally inflate it for a very solid bed or empty it for a softer bed. I like sleeping in the middle of it shrunk, like sleeping on a cloud."
1,"I've never felt anything like this before. This is my first official game, and I am very happy! It's a little big, and a bit tricky but OK. Works great. I would definitely recommend it, especially for the price."
1,"This album contains a wesome  techno . Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You'll definitely get your money's worth from this album. And even though it's over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant."
1,"I'm glad I didn't pay for it.: I received this box as a  gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the box to fill with my own selections. . It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up."
1,Great delivery for all products: Fast delivery for all products. We just received the coffee machine. This is the fourth coffee machine we have bought in thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair straightener are gifts so we don't know how they were loved.
1,"Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about  an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding  batteries to power your pump."
1,"Love it: We recently moved to a smaller place. When my parents came to Medina, they took my older children's room. We needed something to sleep on but we didn't have much room. This double bed is awesome! loved it. . My son says it is very comfortable. It's easy to inflate and deflate."
1,Excellent album: I know this person very well. He always sets very high standards for recording and producing all his albums. This album is no exception.
1,"These shoes are made for walking, great shoes. Although there are small belts in the correct places and adjustable. Shoes that can be taken everywhere! love them."
1,Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on  pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
1,"I bought an airbag and was very impressed with the quality, so I ordered again. It was easy to blow, knit, and very easy to remove and store."
1,"Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this bed, and it's a great price .My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that sleeping on it like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast.  it comes with a canvas bag for store."
1,"Airbag with double pneumatic bed with built-in electric pump: excellent value for money. Comfortable and comfortable, I just hope it is a little higher. I recommend this product."
1,Informative books: I just started growing roses and read many books. That's it and love coordination.
1,Great Details!: Love all the extras in this book. Some of the information is not as up to date as I would like or are not always backed by scientific evidence.I prefer true scientific studies that have used the scientific method to come to their conclusions.
1,"A gentler side of Beethoven.: For the most part, this is a very nice CD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because a couple of pieces had poor recording quality. I could hear background noise. Perhaps they were live recordings. Still, a nice CD overall. I like this softer more gentle side of Beethoven. Very beautiful and enjoyable."
1,Great product: this looks great on the wall and holds the guitar very well. I bought it and liked it. They are adjustable and do whatever you want.
1,Just fine: Shipped in time. Just what I have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to screw it on the wall.
1,"It is easy to mount and properly priced: There is not much to say about this guitar hanger, but it sure is nice for the guitar to be lifted off the ground and easily accessible. I am really happy because I bought this."
1,"Awesome!: I love this toothpaste. It is a natural product, and helps to improve gum disease. I've had slight gum irritation for a few years, and this toothpaste has improved my mouthwash. It is good for oral hygiene and is very important"
1,"Looks great, wonderful size, perfect if it only stayed together... worked for a few days before the front wheels fell off and a few weeks before the rear wheels fell off."
1,"I really appreciate this author's writing style, her stories are colorful and very realistic. It keeps storytelling smart and humorous."
1,"Handy and good : With a wide door, this was a good find. Good value, sufficiently adjustable, looks good and functions well."
1,"Great Birds Guide: I think this book is a great book on birds. It helped me learn bird species from where I was (habitat), as in the past I had no real way to have the basic knowledge to build on in relation to the birds that I would see based on the type of habitat I was in. I think it's a great way to categorize birds, the pictures are great, and the stories, plus identifying information, make this book a good read. I really enjoyed this book, I recommend that bird lovers and fanciers add this book to their collection."
1,Good product: good value batteries. I find it good at a very low cost.
1,"Amazing Actors - Well done !: This actor is my favorite actor. Enjoy seeing that actress paired with him. This movie was well produced. The report showed some of the difficulties husbands may face after marriage. The only thing that caught my attention, and that bothered me, was that the wife's brothers seemed biased against her husband's personality. I believe that once a family member marries someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new husband. Most romantic films focus on relationship through marriage, with the idea that the couple will live happily ever after. However, the truth is that relationships need nurturing after marriage. This movie gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage."
1,"Amazing: I loved this book. Romance and action, love reading the whole story. A book you must read!"
1,"I bought this book because I am a big fan of this author, I enjoyed this book a lot, and it contained a lot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance. The plot was great, I got stuck from the start. My only question is that he did not reveal how the brothers got their gift. The author did an excellent job looking forward to her next book, Well done."
1,A wonderful ancient world change for sure: a very cool story. Well written dynamic work. With complex and dark characters. This book contains a lot of enough romance. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
1,"Great for the money: The picture on this camera is good and needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I would have liked. The digital system might have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon has the best rate available."
1,Fun game: My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. Likes to watch animals pop up and make noises. It's fun to watch his face light up and hear him laugh happily when he hits one of the buttons and the animals appear.
1,"Cruel and unusual: It is the first book I read for this author, I loved it and I cannot wait to read more of her books that my friend told me about, this author has another book that I will read on the new iPad that I got for Christmas, I can't wait, what a wonderful author."
1,"Good deal and fast shipping: I bought this used book and it was in very good condition. I also received it within a week, and that was great."
1,"You have to love this author's series of stories. It's excellent, full of suspense and humor."
1,"Cruel and Unusual: A typical fairy tale novel, easy to read and turns pages, it attracted me and captured me to the end. Enjoy reading it."
1,A great well-paced novel with interesting characters and lots of plot twists. Real and deep personalities. The author's mastery of criminology is remarkable and provides a sense of authenticity that only a few authors achieve.
1,very good !! I can usually find out who did it. Lots of complicated twists and turns. Wonderful read !!!
1,Cruel and Unusual: The book is excellent. I was barely able to let go. Love this series of books and I get excited when I read more.
1,"This was the first novel I read of this author and I must say I was astonished. I sat until the early hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I finished it. The only disappointment was the end. The killer came out of the blue, and there were a lot of loose ends, the story and characters were first class and I intended to read all of her other books."
1,Very nice book: I really liked this book. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that the author  is at her prime in this novel.
1,"Serious Comedy: The movie ""Funny People"", convincing and somewhat attractive, is a comedy movie about a terminally ill whose illness kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights him and returns to enjoy life, his friends and a beautiful woman he meets."
1,"It's clearly not the best movie, an acceptable movie, with some good moments, and some new comedy"
1,Gift: I bought this for my son's Christmas gift. Arrived in perfect condition. My son loves this actor and collects all his movies.
1,"Travel's Best: A funny, cheerful story! A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a comprehensive view of the Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early twentieth century. It is a love story. Very funny and lovable. And the hero is a wicked woman"
1,"Wonderful and Sadly Funny Book: The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box is lovingly pictured by the author. The photos are especially great for the cat. It is a joy to behold, and even better are the stories and anecdotes taken from the life of Jews in North Africa in the 1930s. The stories are very sad and hysterically funny. Much of the book is given to meditations on life, philosophy, love, God, etc. If you like good discussion, you will enjoy this book. The book is very suitable for cat lovers. The author clearly understands cats completely."
1,"Nice size: Very good amount for the price. Smells nice too. However, the smell reminds me of clean laundry. I was wanting something a little different, a little younger. Still smells pretty good though."
1,"I still haven't received the fragrance: I bought this perfume for my mom for Christmas and she loves it, and it smells really good, but I should have had my order by day 20 at the latest. Now night 22 and I'm very worried he won't be here for Christmas. I spoke with Amazons Customer Service and they are replacing the lost item. He will be here tomorrow. I'm still upset because it wasn't here in time for Christmas, but I'm glad they replaced it for me."
1,"Smells like heaven, very nice. Beautiful color and smell! I can't wait long to try this fragrance, I'd like to buy it right away. Good value: I love this type of fragrance, large bottle which makes it very good value. I highly recommend it."
1,"Author's best book: I have read all of her books, and I think she has reached her best in writing this book. The suspense and mystery keep you awake until you finish the book."
1,"Best book on Economics for the general reader: This is an excellent introduction to Economics. the author  was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative. You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader."
1,"Give this book to your children: Economics in one lesson that explains basic principles of economics in simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out in economics, I recommend this as your first book. You will get bored of college textbooks. Also, be sure to give this book to your children."
0,"Stay away from such kind of garbage, it's a completely hard plastic bag, you can never remove it once you put the phone in it, tried a lot of methods carefully and failed, finally it was broken after I took the phone out I will never spend even a penny on these things."
0,"Really overrated baking tools. I thought the heavy-duty bakeware would last with minimal use, but the surface kept peeling off in one wash."
0,"I just want to reassert the problems others have had with this fryer. It is of very poor quality. Food sticks to it, it's easy to clean if you've soaked it in water for a while, but that doesn't serve the purpose. The other thing I noticed was that the pan changed color when I added some turmeric to the vegetables. I have not encountered this problem with other fryers. I also wanted to mention that the cap has a very thin layer of paint, and it requires very careful maintenance. Overall, I am not happy with the quality of this product."
0,"The worst frying pan I have ever used: I know it will be the least nonstick. But I have not seen that. I cooked some eggs in it at a low temperature as the guide says. The whole egg has stuck to the skillet. It didn't go away until soaking it for more than 30 minutes. I threw the box away and there is still some eggs on the pan so I can't get it back. If you are looking for a non-stick frying pan, look elsewhere. This is the worst of its kind."
0,"Worst frying pan ever, everything sticks to it. This frying pan is scary for frying or anything else. I can't believe all the positive reviews and comments about him. This skillet is the worst. You will be sorry if you buy it."
0,"I bought the LCD 3 weeks ago and it broke 2 weeks ago, Sharp doesn't want to replace it, they want to fix it at my home. I've spent the past 2 weeks trying to fix this problem with Sharp, but all I got was either incorrect information or no call back."
0,"I recently bought the full set of 3 DVDs and was happy with the fast delivery but soon my joy faded after watching some episodes due to the poor quality of the audio. Besides, the tablets look like a normal (home made) version. The only thing that makes this ""original"" is the poster printing."
0,"bought this card and it lasted about a month and a half, just became unreadable all of the sudden, good thing I got most of the pictures off!"
0,"I am disappointed with these tools. Food sticks to it every time I use it, especially cheese. The non-stick coating has worn off in some areas, even though I haven't been in the dishwasher. When soaked overnight to get rid of food, it causes rust spots to appear on cooking surfaces."
0,"I cook every day, but I must say this pan is very disappointing. Food sticks to it, the thin handles burn my fingers, and is difficult to handle when stir frying, heating food. It takes a long time. I wonder how he got such good reviews."
0,"I think I'll buy another fryer because I really enjoy a smaller fryer. This skillet seems to stick to everything I've tried. I followed the instructions and turned the heat down, to no avail. It's very difficult to clean the pan after things get stuck in. I wish I hadn't bought it."
0,"I know the natural nature of stones doesn't have a consistent color, but I didn't like the way these earrings turned from light on top to dark at the bottom. Just as the bracelet could have been made with identical stones, I think they could make the earrings the same way."
0,I love the CD which is why I bought it but the CD got very badly scratched and I won't be able to play it.
0,this is soooo bad!: I hate this cd. The worst thing you can buy. This is so bad. Do yourself a favor don't buy this. Save your money!
0,"I own a good amount of sophisticated cookware and do a great deal of cooking. I own several fryers including this one. This is the perfect size, which is originally the reason to buy it, but other than its size, it is useless. Everything sticks to this pan, even when the pan is greased. It was very frustrating to cook in the frying pan and discover that your food is stuck in the pan. Cleaning is difficult. Hand wash all of the pans for preservation, and this is the hardest frying pan to clean. I've read past reviews and followed the advice on cleaning the fryer, but it still looks the same. I decided to order a different brand frying pan."
0,"I don't like citrus fruits, so I'm not a big fan of the scent. It smells like a cream. The lotion works great. I was even using it! Does not leave a greasy feeling. The smell is not overpowering. I will order this product again when it runs out."
0,"I do not write comments. But after purchasing this fryer, I will write a comment. If you are looking for a non-stick frying pan, this one isn't the right one. I love to cook but these are very sticky and not ideal for Indian style of cooking."
0,"I'm sure I was unlucky. The item has arrived but is not usable. The memory card cannot be read with from my camera. When I got back to seller, he refused to refund. Bad seller."
0,The small pots are too small and you can't stir the food if you don't want to mess up your kitchen. The big one is too big and it's for making soup for 10 people. No medium size pot.
0,"Expensive, sorry, amazon, but you are selling this product for 3 times the price you found elsewhere by doing a search for it on Google."
0,"After purchasing so many parts this item disappointed me. Quality was lower than expected. The rough edges dominate the handles on both the pan and the lid, the weight was less than other fryers of the same size, and the shipping or storage of the tray had left a dent on both the pan and the lid. Although it still manages to function, it falls short of the quality one would expect."
0,"After reading the full table of contents before purchasing this book, I thought I had found a great book. Decent projects from design to implementation with examples. Then it turns out that the book really does contain discussions of projects in very poor detail. There were no smart discussions about designs or applications. It lacks any real details."
0,"I received this set as a gift and was initially pleased and impressed. After using the plaster sheets, the paint began to wear. I was expecting the very best from the brand of these pots."
0,even with new battery it does not work: Watch stopped working after two days. We replaced the battery. It worked for an hour or two then stopped. We would love to return it.
0,"A decent iPhone case, that's what I didn't expect at all. The picture in my opinion is deceptive. Please be aware that the casing is not metallic and appears to shine in some light."
0,"Smell is overwhelming: The lotion itself is OK, but the smell is very overwhelming. If you don't want your child to smell like an orange, don't buy this."""
0,"The price was good. The size is suitable. The shoes only lasted 1 week on a very active 8-year-old. Not impressed with the elastic laces. You can't make them remain tied and someone made their way out of the shoe looking for a solution, the advice was to buy new shoes! I'm not happy with the need to replace it after just a one-time wear."
0,I'll give this pan a 2-star rating. The reason for my low rating is that the fryer is much lighter than any other commercial fryer I own. Could this fryer be less good than the group of fryers of the same brand ??
0,"TOO BAD!!!!: Product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web. supportted! I will return it ASAP."""
0,"Too bad, worst frying pan ever !! Food gets stuck every time and cleaning is a nightmare. I'm about to throw it away. I will not buy again."
0,"I was a little disappointed with the book. It has all the basics, but nothing innovative. Contains some simple illustrations. Pictures of the children of the author's friends. I was disappointed that the book couldn't have been more creative. I was hoping for something really extraordinary."
0,"Difficult to use, everything sticks to this surface. It is impossible to use it without making a mess. Fatal error ."
0,"Difficult for little kids, too boring for older kids: I wouldn't buy this game because it's too tough. Too boring! I don't think it will be good for any age. Either it is boring or very difficult."
0,"So small, that's a nice phone case. However, it is small for the iPhone 4s. The bag is shorter than the width of the phone. Should be returned."
0,"It tastes like medicine, coffee tastes like medicine. I will not buy again. Chocolate flavors taste much better."
0,"I ordered this case for iPhone. While it is very nice on the phone and looks great, it is not very protective. The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever. Poor and disappointing portfolio."
0,The muffin tray is ridiculously shallow. The contents of the box do not match the description on the website. Save your money. You have returned it.
0,"When I bought the pot, I was disappointed that the food was sticking to the bottom, no matter what. I followed other users' advice, made sure I used the oil, tried not to put cold foods in it, and gave it several months. I still find that everything that is cooked in this pan sticks. Maybe the unusual thing you bought is bad. Whatever the source of these issues was, I was very disappointed with this fryer. Too bad."
0,"I had this item (skin cream) in my cart to buy it. And thank God that I took a trip to the local natural grocery. They had this ingredient in there and I was able to smell it and pre-test it. Let me just say this nonsense stinks !!!! It was horrible. I don't think someone with a brain would allow their child to smell this lotion. I hated even putting it on my hands, let alone putting it on my baby. just for your information . This lotion is very expensive and smells unworthy."
0,"This book could have been good. The ideas that the author had were fascinating. But everything was said and done, I didnt get what the book was trying to say at all. I was very disappointed because the potential was there."
0,"Software Test and Continuous Quality Improvement Book, Second Edition. Poorly organized and poorly written book. Unfortunately, this book is a requirement for my course, otherwise I'll return it. It is by far the worst textbook I have had to read in my studies."
0,"Everything sticks, worst frying pan I have ever owned. Everything sticks, even with a little cream on it. Generally cheap!"
0,"I was really looking forward to using this frying pan I had on Mother's Day. I am a seasoned cook, but have managed to spoil the rusked meat slices. Food in this skillet sticks to oil much worse than a non-greased stainless skillet. This skillet needs to be patient and not be prone to hysteria when dinner spoils."
0,"I wish I had read the comments more carefully. I bought 2 bottles of this lotion and found the formula irritating to my skin. It smells great and I love that they use natural products, but something in there leaves my skin red and irritated. I think orange spirit is very strong, and I hope to give my bottle to someone who can stand it. I'm sure most people can, but if you have sensitive skin, be careful when ordering this product especially when not sampling it first."
0,"I was using an oil that smelled great. I was disappointed with this lotion. Although it used to work well as a lotion for newborn skin, the scent of orange is overwhelming. It does not smell like the oil I used previously. The smell is very strong and it makes me nauseous."
0,"I was very excited to purchase this piece as it was my first upscale frying pan. They heat up and retain heat well. There are few hot spots that this skillet uses, so cooking in it is great. However, cleaning is another issue. I never put it in the dishwasher. Use only soft sponge to clean it. I clean it up right away after using it (once it cools down). But part of it is starting to erode. Since I eat, the food started to stick."
0,I don't like this product. I will keep it as an added value because I got it at a good price. Food sticks and is difficult to clean. Very disappointed with this product.
0,"I can't believe the price, but when I got the product I realized why it was so cheap it got a strange bottom sticking to everything once it heats up a bit."
0,"I can't believe how terrible this pan is! I own dozens of these quality fryers, and this is by far the worst fryer I have ever bought and used. Everything is stuck like glue, even with the use of olive oil and cooking. This fryer looks cheap compared to other pans. The handles are cheap, the fryer itself is much thinner and not as heavy as you would expect from this brand. It is almost like this fake. Even for the cheap price it is not worth the money you paid for it."
0,"I don't really understand how I gave other people good reviews on this topic. I don't know, maybe my eyeballs are defective ??? All foods are sticky to the pan and difficult to clean. This pan may look good, but it is useless. I will return it."
0,"Don't expect much here: I'm sorry, but I can't give this book a good review. It really isn't worth the money you will spend on it. Sorry, that's how I see it."
0,Don't buy it: It smells bad. I tried four different cartons all smelled the same. awesome!!! Really disgusting hair oil ..
0,Do not waste your money! I received the stroller and used it twice before the handle cracked and squeaked so bad that I couldn't stand it. The back was falling constantly even though my daughter weighed only 20 pounds. Lousy design!
0,"Don't waste your money. I always take care of my things but this bowl is just a waste of money. Rust, it cooks unevenly. I am absolutely upset with it."
0,"Don't waste your money: I've had this unit for 4 months and just tossed it in the trash. The display is so washed out that, unless the room is dark, you can't read the number."""
0,"This pan cannot be put through the dishwasher. Had I known I would be scrubbing by hand, I never would have purchased it."""
0,"I am not satisfied with this purchase. The cup is unbalanced, sometimes it turns. I need to bring it back now."
0,"I loved everything about this stroller, but after a few uses I noticed that the front wheel was not touching the ground, so the stroller constantly swept left. I have 4 boys so i need something i can push with one hand and it was very hard to push it. I prepared it with full intentions to get another one, but noticed that the floor model was doing the same thing, and the existing model did the same too. I'm disappointed that everything else about the stroller was great."
0,I rented this game for my 3 year old son .. he tried to play it he couldn't. I tried to play it couldn't. I tried for 5 days. My rental time has expired. Prepared by. I haven't rented it since. This game is hard to beat. And my 3-year-old got bored pretty quickly. I will not recommend this game to anyone. Don't waste your money buying it. Unless you are an expert at video games. I am grateful I have rented it instead of buying it.
0,"I bought a pair of these shoes but they shipped the wrong size and when I asked if I could replace it, the company in charge said, I can. I sent the shoe again and left several emails over a number of weeks but they didn't respond at all. So, if you want to buy."
0,"I bought this fryer earlier this year, it heats up efficiently. But everything I cook in it sticks and gets stuck in it. The last time I used it, I was cooking green beans in sweet soy sauce, and it got burnt. I couldn't get rid of it no matter how hard I tried .... I could finally get rid of it without feeling guilty."
0,"I bought this after reading positive reviews about this product on because it's organic. I had read the comments that mentioned the rash, but I was not alarmed that my son had not had any skin issues since he was born. I wish you paid more attention to these comments. After using it for 3 days, my son who has beautiful skin started having a rash on his cheeks. I thought it was a drought in the winter, but it kept getting worse. So, I stopped using this and replaced it with castor and sesame oil instead. My main complaint about the product is it caused a rash on a child who had not had skin problems earlier. Smells too strong for baby lotion."
0,"I bought this piggy bank for my little boy as his first bank. I loved that it was plastic and thought it wouldn't break but when my son dropped it it disintegrated in a few different places. This was the first day, the first time I fell. Very frustrating thing."
0,"I bought these about a year and a half ago and were not very successful. I am very disappointed I have a problem with everything stuck to this stuff, I don't recommend buying these. Even the oily baking sheets of biscuit stick! """
0,"We bought this piggy bank for our baby and discovered, disappointingly, that it was not strong enough to handle much. We fill it in and it divides the whole in half. This split did not occur as a result of a fall or trauma in any way. It only split when it got full. As a result, I cannot recommend them due to wrong design or improper material selection."
0,We've tried many different products over the past three and a half years. This is the clear winner. It is rich and creamy without being greasy. And it has a pleasant light orange scent. I love the natural ingredients in this and it softens my son's complexion so wonderfully. Continue until the next day! I even use it on myself sometimes! Strongly recommend it.
0,I paid $ 500 for this watch and the frame broke within 6 months. It looks so cheap. I do not recommend this watch. Terrible purchase on my part.
0,"I have ordered this watch as a brand new watch. You are not. Obviously, it was a very used watch. It's a great watch, but I was disappointed that it isn't new. I will keep looking for a new model as this one is no longer in production. It took about a month to get the money back."
0,"I was excited when I found this stroller. Thought it would be great price for a stroller with a lying umbrella, but it seems like it's a situation where you get paid for what you pay. The canopy on the stroller is awful, and that's my biggest complaint."
0,"I just reached the end of this book, I can honestly say this is a bad book. I give him one star. I would never recommend it to anyone. It's not good, I don't even know where to start. Bad."
0,"I did not receive the item you ordered. Very disappointed. I ordered the fragrance as advertised but I received the cologne, a big difference between the two."
0,"I heard nothing but good things about this lotion. Since I used it for my daughter it started showing a rash. Doesn't moisturize well. It also smells very strong than alcohol, possibly because it contains a lot of alcohol."
0,"Not good for Asian cooking, too small to fit usual size for Asian cooking, sticky, expensive, the lid is not necessary and too heavy. Don't buy this fryer if you want an Asian frying pan."
0,Spectacular: I know this book brought up quite a stir a while back but I never got to read it... I am so glad for that
0,Time consuming: This is very boring and boring and the parts it contains are very tough and stupid. Throw this in the trash and get the movie instead
0,"My favorite fryer, I bought it about 6 weeks ago and I don't know how to cook without it. Very happy with it. It is really multi-purpose. Stir fry, make sauces, and bake in them. Help me save time."
0,"Great and versatile frying pan, original made, the quality of this fryer is quite good, food is non-stick, hand wash only. Great great for very cheap price. This skillet is an excellent way to start."
1,"Great frying pan, the best frying pan I have ever bought. Great for everything from soup to stir fry. I want the full set. Easy to clean and sturdy, the handles are fixed in the pan, and there is no plastic to worry about melting away."
0,"A very cheap frying pan, but it worked for 5 or 6 years. Since I bought it I just made my last boiled egg in it and threw it in. Everything sticks! I mean not just eggs, but everything. I'm thinking of getting another nonstick frying pan."
0,"Too bad frying pan, it sticks to almost anything you cook. It burns your hands. I have bought it at a local store, i will return it immediately."
0,"Very durable frying pan that looks well built. However, the problem of sticking together with all proteins is significant. Eggs, meat etc. You can forget about cooking in this skillet. Cleaning pain. Honestly, I wished I hadn't bought this fryer."
0,Frying Pan and Lid: Frying pan as advertised. It's the right size. The handles are easy to use. Cleaning the pan easily and quickly.
0,"Poor quality frying pan, I bought it, and the little saucepan, as they were up for sale at a great price. I thought the brand was a respectable one. But it did show some wear. I know for sure this is a health hazard, and fryers are useless now. Please don't waste your money on these fryers."
0,"This pan is extremely difficult to clean, even when following the written instructions. I am very disappointed with this product. Do not recommend buying this pan at any price."""
0,"These pots are definitely not up to their branding, everything sticks to them, and it's very difficult to clean. Sure, it's not that expensive, but I happily pushed for the best non-stick material. Some say you need to wash it by hand, but its description clearly states that you can use a dishwasher safe. 10-year warranty. In general I will not buy it again."
0,The product you received smells of vanilla and orange! This is not indicated anywhere. I don't have time to go back so I guess I'm stuck smelling decent! It is stuck in my clothes.
0,"poor product: it has a heavy chain, a hook that cannot hook securely, and sharp edge that connect the watch and the chain can hurt."""
0,"Bad product,Worked for a couple of months and then failed to be recognized by any computer or camera. I lost some pictures and videos because of that. I would give it a zero but the least is one star."
0,horrible product: i got this product after 16 days of ordering... hasn't worked right since i bought it... doesn't play majority of my DVD's and quits half way.
0,Stupid Soundtrack: The instumentation and background singers are lame. It is one of the most unprofesssional soundtracks I have ever heard. Don't buy it!
0,"I looked at consumer reviews and reviews online before purchasing this cart. I wasn't happy with how heavy it was. I don't recommend this cart, it's hard to get in and out of the car."
0,"A low-quality type of skillet. All the reviews and comments say I love it with very little detail, then when you mention how thin or how easy it is for food to stick to it or how difficult it is to clean it, it didn't get many helpful reviews, as I smell trying to persuade customers to accept new inexpensive, thin and crunchy pans."
0,"Good quality: For the price, this set is excellent value and very good quality. I would like to warn anyone who buys these, to make sure the pans are dry immediately after washing them. Because water collects in the coiled edges and a great deal of water can flow out and rust."
0,"This is a good picture book and a good introduction to history but the atlas is not! The maps are really shoddy, neither particularly useful nor appealing to look at. One would have expected much better in this book, and the author should be disappointed."
0,"This is the worst product ever, don't buy it. This is a type of food that sticks to. They show you pictures of both non-stick pans and they sell you a sticker. We were cheated by this deception. Beware, people."
0,This is the worst frying pan ever. Follow all instructions from the manufacturer; it burns the food the first time and every time since. Don't waste your money on buying like it !!!
1,"You should get this CD. The musicians are great, one of the guitarists was my guitar teacher, and the singing is great. I give it five stars because it's a really cool band and a great CD."
1,"This book contains great ideas if you are going to shower at home, but if you are bathing elsewhere, it might not be helpful."
0,"Please make sure that you want to wear this for a short period of time before you choose to purchase this item. If your intention is long-term, it's not yours because you have to arrange one that will last. It's too expensive ."
0,The food stays attached to the bottom of the pan. Inappropriate size. The lid cannot be turned over on the frying pan when storing on the shelf. So nothing can be placed on it for shelving storage. This fryer has been returned.
1,"I like food sticking to the pan. So I thought we'd try something new and I think that's a very good frying pan. Food will stick if you run it too hot. It takes a little practice, but it's a good product. I'll buy more from it."
1,Love the history of these buildings and the entertaining way in which they provide information. It's also great to see buildings and hear they're used now.
1,"love this lotion!: I know this lotion is expensive, but so worth it! No harsh chemicals, like so many other baby products! Would recommend this to friends and family."
1,"Love this skillet, it's the best frying pan I have ever used. I find myself using it over and over again. I cook food evenly and is easy to clean."
1,"I love this product, it keeps hair in great condition. Leaves hair soft, I will buy it again in the near future."
1,"I've always wanted this set of cookware. It is very good and useful in the kitchen, I use it in my daily cooking. I love it very much."
1,I use this skillet a lot more than I thought. It heats up quickly and evenly and is easy to clean. Love her.
1,I've been using this kit for over a year now and it's an essential tool for any fish breeder. Good instructions I highly recommend it to all fish breeders - from beginner to professional.
1,"As a continuation of this author's fantastic graphic novel series, this addition brings a wonderful smile to my face in seeing the heroes of the story together. Although their time with each other is short, every moment was filled with adventure and intrigue. From start to finish, this is a great addition."
1,"I bought this piggy bank as a gift for my grandson. When he has money to save, he likes to make a decision about where to put his money. It is transparent so that it can visually see the coins placed in each section."
1,"Best bakeware I got as a gift - I was thrilled! From the first use, the quality was evident as the baked goods were beautifully browned with no burnt edges, the non-stick surface is great. Designed to withstand almost any misuse, it cleaned quickly and is a great addition to my kitchen."
1,"Big mugs, we were very happy with these mugs. It is good for the price, and keeps the temperature well. Great for the price."
1,"Super safe, smells great. This is a product that I feel 10000% safe putting on my toddler. All ingredients are super safe. Love, love, love this stuff. Smells so yummy too."
1,I love this case for my iPhone. The colors are really shiny. It's also a perfect fit for 4s. Really nice case for the price; very happy with it.
1,"I am new to the aquarium hobby and the idea of ??testing its waters was very frightening to me. However, after some encouragement from some well-experienced amateurs, I came out with this group. I must say that she is totally worth it. Worth all the money."
1,"I am a firm believer in the fact that everyone has a purpose on this earth. No matter your history, background, gender, classroom, or anything else, you have been put on this planet for a reason, even if you don't think you discovered it. A great read for those looking for philosophical quotes and the author's insight into life."
1,"Premium Quality Cookware, I will recommend everyone our Oxidized Solid Cookware. I've used it for years and it works great. It heats up quickly, retains heat ... it saves me energy. Food does not stick to it if heated enough. Plus, you can scrub and scrub and don't worry about peeling off the layers like these pesky Teflon-coated products."
0,"Oh, what an iPhone case. Too bad the quality is so poor. Yes, it is cheap. The thin and fragile clear plastic sides do not provide any protection to the front of the phone."
1,I started using this type of fragrance because it always reminds me of my grandmother. The scent evokes fond memories of the wonderful woman I no longer spend time with. It's a timeless scent and I always get compliments on this perfume.
1,"As a contractor, I have tried many brands and types of brushes. A word of advice for those thinking of purchasing any other brand of paintbrush ... don't do it. Certain brands are of incredibly high quality. With proper care and cleaning, it will last a lifetime, remain solid. In fact, after a while, this brush acquires smoothness as well as an attractive look on the metal."

This piggy bank has been great for our family and has helped our son ask questions about money in general, where it comes from, etc. He is more aware of wanting or seeking things.

I bought three more pairs to give to relatives this Christmas, and they are also happy with the earrings, the reason why I'm not giving me five stars is because the earrings don't look like the picture. However, as I said, I am happy with the product I will buy more of it."
1,"I bought one of these last week, and it became a favorite in my kitchen. The curved sides keep the food in the pan, the pan doesn't slide on the new glass burner top, and the domed lid (shaped like a dome) is perfect for the cooking style I tend to do, and it's cool overall. The specific things I like about it are: The lid fits perfectly, the knobs stay cool enough that in most cases I manage to grab the pans off the top of the stove without the benefit of a pot holder, the pan is really spacious, but it fits perfectly on the stove, the non-stick finish is great. In fact, I love this fryer so much, it's the perfect fryer."

I love the cover. The fryer looked brand new and was a great value to us."
1,I've been using this frying pan a lot for six years and it's still going strong. It's the only large fryer I own and the only one I need. You have used it successfully for everything. A thorough scrub from time to time makes the interior look practically fresh; Some of the cooked grease on the outside is difficult to clean. It can be kept in perfect condition. There is no better frying pan to be found for virtually any cooking project.
1,I've been using this for a while and it's really cool. It has a lot of tests so I never worry about running out of tests. The tests have really helped us improve and improve our aquarium. Strongly recommend it.

1,"Nice clean skillet, food less sticky to it. Good quality covered 12-inch skillet."
1,"A versatile skillet, it's great for cooking a meal like soup too. Although classified as a commercial skillet, it can be used as a serving piece on a table thus eliminating something else that needs to be washed. My experience is that things are cooked evenly and it is very easy to see what has been completely cooked. I love to display pots and pans so I have to work a bit harder to give them their original luster."
0,"Boring, I kept reading this book waiting for something good to happen but it never happened. Most of the book appears to be copied from other books. I was misled by the positive reviews for this book on Amazon.com. Honestly, this book is not very good. Finally, the grammatical errors are terrible."

0,"Not worth the money: I was given this mirror as a gift, and was very disappointed in it. Lousy design, blurry, I initially thought it was covered in plastic or maybe it was covered for protection in shipping, but it was poorly made. Not worth the money. I struggled with using it a lot."
0,"I enjoyed reading the book, but am very disappointed that I did not get the cover for my book. Buying the new book at the bookstore was light, the book was torn off the cover, however I paid the full price for the damaged book. It's as if the publisher didn't bother including the cover photo and didn't care whether readers wanted the cover photo or not, the lack of the cover diminished my enjoyment of the book."
0,What Happened to This Story ?: I was very disappointed with this latest installment of the series. It started in a long way and ended in a whirlwind of meaningless events. I will not rush to read the next installment.
0,"Very frustrating, almost sad: This is a really poor performer. The story lacks the usual passion, and it has a plot that seems to lead nowhere. I couldn't help but feel that the author wanted this story to end as quickly as possible. The author needs to follow up with a very impressive feat if he wants to hold on to legions of his fans."
0,"PRINTABLE NON-WEAR: My first black and color cartridge worked fine and worked fine (ink ran out a little faster than I expected). When I opened the packaging of the next black cartridge, the ink spilled from the package and on my shirt and jeans. The same thing happened with the next color cartridge. The price for this product cost me a couple of jeans and two shirts. Not really worth it."
0,"This book is slow, I thought it had a terrible ending. After finishing the book I felt cheated. I don't think the characters have been fully explored, the story was muddled at times and I felt the ending should be the beginning of the true story."
0,Well and good but not great: I liked this author's book so I was interested in other works of her. This was a good read but not very impressive.
0,"Scary and action-packed for dad to see !: As a father, it's a very scary movie to watch, but it's packed with action and excitement. You find yourself at the edge of your seat hoping that it all ends up fine. worth watching"
0,Won't play: The copy protection on this movie prevented it from playing in both my TV or my computer.
0,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER !: Read all negative comments carefully before considering this product. Others have written more comprehensively and thoughtfully of what I can do about toner cartridge issues with this printer. It is an obvious and conscious theft from this company to make you invest a great deal of money in ink cartridges within a very short period of time. The device stops working until you replace the cartridges with new ones. What a bad piece of engineering. Learn from my mistake Read comments before you buy.
0,"nice cover: nice outer packaging but real surprise is inside when its not what is on the cover,  check your packages and make accuracy a priority ."
0,Superficial: I have watched and reviewed hundreds of films. This movie isn't worth the price of popcorn and drinks to watch. Too frustrating. Don't watch it.
0,"Sensors: There's not enough information about the problems that occur when certain ""sensors"" are not functioning properly. It seems to be a guessing game."
0,"Good price speakers, ridiculous shipping price: For me, these speakers are the best brand, but the shipping rates are ridiculous for these headphones, as two sellers charge 600+ and one of them charges 1000+, that's just for two headphones, with this money you can buy all audio systems And not just two speakers."
0,a movie that EVERY young girl and her parents should watch. It scary to think how fast young people can find themselfs in trouble.
0,"WAS NOT EFFECTIVE: I Purchased the Thai Deodorant Stick for my daughter and it truly did not hold her,her underarms were very smelly and wet"
0,"This book is only an overview of the sport of falconry. Its purpose is to introduce the reader to this sport and to prepare them for the amount of dedication it takes to own a falcon. There is very little practical ""how-to"" information in this book. There are no training details. There are no care details. Save your money. A magazine or website about falconry would be a better place to find the kind of information this book offers."
0,Indoor work only: This product is claimed to operate outdoors. But it did not work well outdoors during outdoor events.
0,"I have purchased a timer to use for my external lights. I cannot turn it on or off from inside the house. I had to go about two feet for the start and stop process to work, it was not working properly. Stay away from this product. I bought another timer switch that works great. And with less money."
0,Doesn't work in the cold: I put this in my garage. It does not work when the outside temperature reaches 40 ° F. Bad product
0,"The front of this product indicates that it can be used outside the house in the open air, and the back of the product is written on it that it is not suitable for use in places where it is directly exposed to water, but it is raining in the open air. I worked this product for about a week outside then it stopped working and I can't turn it on anymore. I do not recommend it."
0,"Gentle, but painful: This shoe is so cute but the fabric is so stiff and rough that it made it impossible for me to wear it for more than half an hour before taking it off. I don't like having to ""break"" a shoe. It is not only uncomfortable but also painful. Well, I guess I got what I paid for."
0,"Not waterproof: We got this watch for my daughter as a birthday gift. The watch did not last until 3 months. My daughter jumped into the pool and the clock was dead. Of course at this stage there is no exchange or refund. We bought her a second watch, a different color the same. It clearly states it is water resistant to 99 feet. My daughter has never come close to that. We are very disappointed in this kind of watch."
0,"I think the water on the watch face is a very good indication that this watch is not really ""water resistant"" to 99 feet. The bathtub is probably 16 inches deep and that is the only place our 5-year-old daughter used this in the two days she has had it. When your child thinks she has broken her birthday gift when, in fact, it was just a cheap watch. Not good."
0,"I used to love this product just as many do. Unfortunately, a small piece of the knife blade broke into the food I was cutting, and if I hadn't seen it, my kids could have swallowed the blade. . After you were well aware of the danger, the manufacturer's only response was to offer another blade of the same dangerous blade."
0,"Dangerous chair: Within months of owning this rocking chair, the back broke from where it came into contact with the seat! My mother-in-law was shaking my daughter to sleep - without warning or anything. Very disappointing considering the cost of the chair. I will contact the manufacturer to see if I can get a refund and buy a different chair."
0,"Disappointed: The handle is too small. The metal is very soft, so that scratches are very easy. very cheap. The quality is not high. I will never buy cookware of this brand again ..."
0,"This rocking chair is a gift for my sister. We were disappointed to learn that the cargo delivered was damaged and the chair leg was broken. The shipment also arrived without notice so it came while they were on vacation. We wondered why we had been asked to give their phone number if no one intended to contact them about the shipment. We were so embarrassed that we put my sister and her husband into so much overtime when it was supposed to be a nice gift. Once everything is fixed, they will be happy with the product."
0,"Dont buy it: If you are not a professional chef don't buy it. I only used it once and it became yellow. I decided to return it, since after one day of using it, it looked just like my 5 year old cookware."
0,"Stop! Don't buy this set of litter. This set of pots and pans is the largest litter I have ever bought. Within two weeks, all of the pots and pans in this set were either scattered, stained, or chipped. Be careful, buyer."
0,"Worst game ,This game is not good at all. It is not fun to play and it just gets you dizzy. I would not recommand it, unless you are 10 years old and under. Do not buy it!"
0,"I was looking forward to having my own cappuccino maker and received it as a gift. I read the comments about it. After a few weeks of use, it started leaking from below. She took the machine back to the store and got a replacement. After six months, start again. I am very disappointed. I neither recommend this company nor the device."
0,"Do not buy it rubbish garbage garbage. I only had this year and it started leaking from the bottom, telling you it's not worth 20 dollars let alone 100 dollars."
0,"I got this coffee maker late last year. It's beautiful on the outside and a number of comments on similar machines raised my hopes, I had serious problems with the machine. The steamer was difficult to use and ended up burning my hands. For the first six months or so, the coffee machine worked fine. About two months ago, I noticed the water tank starting to leak. I would probably have half a cup of water on my table from this machine every day."
0,"The coffee machine broke down within 4 months of purchase. It will be fixed and shipped again for free, but it is very frustrating. I should have brought it back to the store to get my money back straight away, but I waited too long. Avoid this brand and this device at all costs. It looks cute on the box, but it's a plastic piece of litter. For the price I paid for, I could go to a kitchen ware store and buy a quality product made of metal."
0,Don't buy this machine.: This is an awful machine for making lattes. Coffee is not hot and the milk frothing mechanism is archaic. Bought it because of the dual type coffee maker. Big mistake!
0,"Wacky movie: Put this movie at the bottom of the main Free Watch list. Maybe if you stone him, that movie might make sense ..."
0,"Awesome frying pan !: I have never bought a cheaper set of fryers in my life. These are very lightweight and the bottom peels off the paint. I don't own a dishwasher, so it's cheap. My husband is a cook and I wanted to surprise him with a new set of fryers and how disappointing this was! You made me cry! Don't buy it."
0,Branded DVD: The problem with this CD is that you cannot skip from episode to episode which makes it nearly useless.
0,"A piece of trash ... it was used once and broke, I got it by exchanging the miles I use for the airline. I used it once and it worked fine, but after a week it didn't work. Simply press the button to make drip coffee but the water will not boil. After seeing the comments, I think it's not a surprise. Shouldn't there be a recovery for this unwanted piece?"
0,"I have to agree with the other reviewers for this product. This coffee maker is not good. Don't even think about getting it. The coffee maker side stopped working just three weeks after I bought it. We have other issues with this unit that other reviewers have pointed out. The foam is useless. It's not frothy well, and the way it's made, you can't get a tall or even medium-sized jug of milk to effectively froth. I took it back and got my money back. I'd rate it with zero stars if I could."
0,"Cheap: The machine stopped working completely after two months of light use. Bad electronics, lousy quality check."
0,"I've got this for 2 months, I really liked it at first, and the battery was already depleted. Most of the time, I hardly hear the person on the other end of the line. What a disappointment."
0,"I had experience writing resumes for corporate jobs and just hope this book gives me some ideas for an excellent resume. In fact, the book contained many poor examples of biographies that were not clear and poorly presented. It was a résumé I would never consider sending to someone who already has the ability to hire me for fear that the résumé would immediately end up in the trash. Do not use these examples and do not waste your money."
0,I am not very happy with this book: I am afraid that I did not find this book very useful. I forced myself to read a few chapters and couldn't communicate with the author. I regret to say that I will never recommend this book to anyone.
0,"Usually I don't bother reading comments about something I didn't like, but this recording was so disappointing that I have to speak up. I had read the editorial comments and impressed me, but clearly I hadn't read enough. I listened to the first third of this recording and was so bored with the music and so disappointed with the story that I would get rid of it as quickly as I could."
0,"Noisy to the ears: I thought it must be something humans cannot hear but is noisy, it is more of a human repellent than an insect repellant"
0,"I am a beginner flash user. The book contains many errors. I had to repeat some exercises a few times and not make them all work, even using the code on the CD. They got you to write a symbol without telling you how to create it. Anyway, this is the last thing I buy from these authors !!!"
0,"This is not very good. I thought the acting was so bad, the special effects were so bad, the suspense was so bad. The movie is barely an hour long. I guess I would have been in a hurry to finish it."
0,It didn't work for toast at all. He hummus only one side. I don't know if the product we purchased is defective or if they are all like this. We brought it back.
0,"Snooze fest.: This was a waste of time. If I wanted to watch something that would put me in the mood to sleep; I would select this DVD. None of the characters were likeable or admirable. The story line was tragic, but I didn't really care about any of the characters enough to feel any empathy for their circumstance. Save your money."
0,"Same Product - Multiple Names, Different Prices: Please check the following product. The same product with different names and with multiple prices."
0,Dissatisfied: This was my parents' Christmas gift to replace the old one. Not of good quality. They said they felt like children. My parents will probably take it back and buy something else. I do not recommend this product.

I love the content of this book, but I'm upset about the book's status. It was supposed to be in perfect condition, but it's not."
0,"Not what I was thinking: I bought two copies of the same book. Announced as brand new; Obviously, it was not new but rather damaged. I am very disappointed. """
0,It's amazing how one person could create such a stunningly spoiled book. I think this is funny nonsense. Perhaps the author and his uneducated wife spent an amazing weekend creating this trash.
0,"Contempt: After flipping this book, I felt underrated and offended. This book is made as if it were designed for the fourth grader. The assumption made by its design and content is that teachers are either incompetent or too stupid to understand the more intricate nuances. I've read many other books (not designed specifically for educators) and they are much more complex, and full of worthwhile content. The space in this book is wasted on crossword puzzles while it should be devoted to the actual advice and strategies that will make the book realistic and successful for today's teachers. Very disappointing."
0,WANT MY MONEY BACK !: What a disappointment and a waste of time. The first book I bought I never bothered to finish. Nothing is there between the characters.
0,"Save your time, save money !: This is the first book I read by this writer. It lacks the essential ingredient to capture the reader's interest - a creative and interesting plot.

0,"What a disappointment !: I am a big fan of this author, but unfortunately I have to say this was a real disappointment. I've read 250 pages so far and can't force myself to read more. I crave the quality of her other books. Her experience lies in romance, horses, and farms. As I was reading this, I felt that her heart and soul were not in it when I wrote. Don't waste your money - that's bad."
0,"Unfortunately, I had to read this book, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. While it was very useful, it was very dry. This is because it was not for fun, but for information."
0,"This necklace is very poor quality. I needed to take it in direct light before I saw any stones, nothing like the image shown. There is no invoice in the box, unfortunately, I cannot return."
0,Really BAD: The product was in a very old box and the AC/DC connection was just a bare wire. So I did return this item.
0,"I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons. First off this product did not teach me much of the Italian language, which is its whole purpose. Secondly, I felt very lost from one part to another it just seemed very unclear as to what I was always supposed to be doing. My advice is to consider a competitor's product before this one."
0,"I was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal jug. At first, the machine was great. Then after two weeks, the coffee started pouring straight out of the machine onto the floor! I thought I might have had a bad machine, so I put it back in the store and replaced it with a new one. A month later, the same problem! . I burned myself trying to clean it, and it had stained the floors of my lovely kitchen. I will return it."
0,Very disappointing: I liked the characters. He did a great job of letting the reader get to know the characters. However the plot was awful. At the end I was left feeling like he just threw a bunch of words together just to end the book.
0,"Old Program, Poor Tutoring: The product once installed looks like its from 1990, and all it does is quiz you. It doesn't really explain anything and it's not very interactive. "
0,"Poor Quality: I bought this shirt for one reason, the price, and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap. Because of the cheap materials. Save your money, spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality."
0,"Weird Weird Weird Weird!!!!!!: This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring! The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV, but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the TV back on.  Please don't buy this book, you are supporting a lunatic."
0,"So upset with this rice cooker that the very fragile rubber ring on the lid tore. Be careful. It's cool but won't last long, this feature makes it very weak. Now it doesn't make good rice anymore. The cost to fix it renders it useless because I will have to fix it again in 10 months. It is not suitable for someone who cooks a lot of rice, as it will not last."
0,We haven't found a solution yet to fully inflate this air bed. So we haven't used it yet. I think I should have just bought it at a local store. The instructions are very bad.
0,"After purchasing it for our home library, I couldn't wait to read it. I felt bored and unmotivated throughout the reading. It is the contradictions in the story that make it difficult and harsh to read. I cannot imagine any of the enthusiastic young readers enjoying this book and all of its expectations."
0,"Worst Primer I Ever Used: As other reviewers have suggested, this book is full of errors. This book is almost useless. There are several errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source of any information that I didn't know was actually accurate. This, of course, conflicts with the purpose of the study guide. Many mistakes are evident this book is not worth the time."
0,"First, I found that this cream had a strange odor. Secondly, it hydrates well but not as I expected and hoped it is disappointing and I am not planning to repurchase it again. There are other products that I love but this one is definitely not one of them!"
0,"This CD is not worth listening to. Really it's just trash. One of the worst CDs. Thank you very much, you are welcome"
0,Comes an annoying amount of hum and hissing from the speakers. The noise is still in the amplifier and it increases whenever I lift the volume knob. It's quite loud and annoying
0,"I got the tea quickly, I followed the instructions, and only drank half a cup, which had no effect on my diet, except it tastes very good."
0,"I picked this book thinking it would be fine (yes, judge the books by the covers). It was horrible ... I'm not sure why I kept reading it all the way. Boring ... bored. I don't even know what the author was trying to communicate to the public. If you don't want to waste your time, do not read this book."
0,This product  is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
0,"We bought this rice cooker because everyone cares about it, but it has a big drawback, it's slow slow very slow: I tried two cups of brown rice this evening. After 75 minutes, the water began to boil. As a working mother, I don't have two hours to make rice every evening. The old rice machine was cooking white rice in 15 minutes, brown rice in 30 minutes."
0,"These lights are not blue, they are fake, and there is no difference at all here, they do not deserve one star, definitely do not buy them..it is a waste of time and money."
0,"I read selected chapters from the book, the writing was terrible. Many parts are unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over again. I can't stand this style of writing. The author is trying to appear interesting and intelligent. Instead, it sounds boring. Skip this book and try something else"
0,"Horrible waste of money !: This tape should be sold in audio only. The views of the caves are very dark, and there is no point in viewing them; The direction is weak, character development is non-existent. It is very bad that the rating system does not have the option of zero or negative stars."
0,movie was a waste of money: this movie totally sucks. i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money. the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened. dont buy it.
0,Horrible product: This shirt is the absolute worst on the market. The fabric is so cheap and so cheap that I threw it away.
0,"Worst Thin & Unprofessional Canvas Shirts Ever: I didn't know Amazon had poor quality control and also had no control over other sellers, Save $ 8 by not purchasing this product ... T-Shirts are too thin and too bulky."
0,"The displayed temperature is incorrect: The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor. Prepared thermometer for exchange from amazon. The replacement has the same issue that I calibrated, and it's still showing the wrong temperature. I liked the ease of installation on the window and the size, but it's just as useless as the value it shows for the temperature."
0,"dont read this book!: My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring!  dont read this book unless you want somthing really, really boring!"
0,Wrong size: I have no idea how good or bad this product is. Amazon has announced a size M for this product and has ordered it. When it came it was S. and I didn't know it until after my grandson put it back saying it was the wrong size. When I searched it was an S.
0,"Difficult Read: This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled, I keep losing track of which character is being talked about. I have read and reread the story, but still have difficulty summarizing the story. The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow. Use caution when reading this story."
0,"I read the comments about this disk, it is not working. I thought it was old comments and fixed the problems. Very frustrating as they are still selling this defective CD."
0,"Paper Jams, Swollen Driver, Lockdowns: To start, installing the software for the printer is problematic. I had trouble installing it even though I am in the IT field. Why do you need a 40MB to 200MB driver that requires you to turn off the antivirus during the installation ?! The printer jams a lot and sometimes freezes during printing. While I think HP business printers are great, this consumer printer is unimportant."
0,"Not worth the money: I was given this mirror as a gift, and was very disappointed in it. Lousy design, blurry, I initially thought it was covered in plastic or maybe it was covered for protection in shipping, but it was poorly made. Not worth the money. I struggled with using it a lot."
0,"I enjoyed reading the book, but am very disappointed that I did not get the cover for my book. Buying the new book at the bookstore was light, the book was torn off the cover, however I paid the full price for the damaged book. It's as if the publisher didn't bother including the cover photo and didn't care whether readers wanted the cover photo or not, the lack of the cover diminished my enjoyment of the book."
0,What Happened to This Story ?: I was very disappointed with this latest installment of the series. It started in a long way and ended in a whirlwind of meaningless events. I will not rush to read the next installment.
0,"This is a very interesting movie that consists of five stories in one. A girl is found dead and every story is affected in one way or another. Great cast and sincere dialogue make this person worth your time. The movie is ultimately sad and frustrating, but every story is very exciting."
0,"Very disappointed: This arrived in a different package and bottle than shown. The box has tear marks and is beat up. It also has a nasty, dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed."
1,"Everything is fine, the DVD arrived in a timely and specific manner, and was very successful, my daughter loves him very much. Thank you"
1,"An interesting and interesting movie, which contains soundtracks. I have it on my device and I listen to it while I work, it's very fun."
1,"Good piggy bank: I expected it to be bigger. You got it as a gift for someone and they will enjoy it. You wanted him to store money in it, and now it will look better than anything else as a decor. Anyway, it's still very pretty and extraordinary, which is why I got it."
1,"Good product: This cart is just what I was looking for. Well fit. Easy storage of coats and small items. It is easy to assemble. Not great if you're looking for a ""super-strong"" ""container, but great for the simple things."
1,"Liked so much, I bought a second one: it can be converted into drawers for extra storage. Easy to assemble, strong, light, cheap."
1,"A Great Inexpensive Phone Charger: The charger works fine. I have not come across such an inexpensive charger anywhere. If you lost the original charger that came with the phone, this is a great replacement."
1,"Excellent movie, I watched it over and over again. It kept getting better for me. I'm glad I bought it."
1,"Awesome Movie: This is a great movie with suspense , action and excitement.I am glad it was available to watch online."""
1,"Great action movie. The start was a little slow, but once we move on to the girl being kidnapped, it was cool. I began to think that it was impossible for this actor to make a bad movie. His acting is always great"
1,"Interesting but a downer: A pretty good first novel but what a grim view of a side of life, I am glad I not involved in. Compelling and strange with a resolution that seemed too pat."
1,"All I can say is that the game is really cool, it's very fun and exciting. But I think the game is too short for players to reach the limit, you can finish the game without even getting close to it."
1,"Really cool movie !! I recommend it to everyone. Whether you are a fan or not of the cast in the movie, it's still a great movie and well worth the purchase! Interesting !"
1,"This video is actually a Christmas gift to my daughter, and I don't know anything about the movie. However, my daughter was happy to receive it. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
1,Youthful Music: I'm really good at hearing all those old songs from the really cool band of my era.
1,"I love this book. I had a copy many years ago, and I forgot all about it until I saw an old copy covered in dust on the bookshelf at work. When I picked it up to look at it, I immediately remembered why I loved it. Unfortunately the copy was badly molded, so I went online to buy another copy. I am glad I found a new copy for sale, and when I got it, it was much larger than the previous version. The images are much larger, the text is easier to read, a great classic book for any nature lover."
1,"This is a great series, but save yourself time and grief and read the summary on Wikipedia. You will not miss a thing."
1,"This was a very good movie, with a lot of action. Maybe next weekend I'll be watching Part 2, I can't wait"
1,This was one of the best movies I've watched in a great time! It's packed with action and made me on hold wondering what would happen next! The things this father goes through to find his daughter is amazing!
1,Awesome: This movie was awesome! A lot of work. Acting is very good in this movie. Good film writing and production. I would recommend it to everyone.
1,"HIGHEST ACTION AND ACTION !: If you love heart-pounding, action and suspense! This is not a joke! I give this A +! do not miss it!"
1,"Excellent: great drama, great story. The only flaw is the reliability of the performance of one of the actors in some financial aspects. Still a great movie I'll watch again."
1,"Very good: Well, I don't really listen to this kind of music, or I'm not interested in much, but I think this is a very good album."
1,"Works great.: Arrived without problem. It wasn't in it's original packaging and the wire that came with it was grey as opposed to black (like the product) so it made me think that it might be refurbished. That said, I haven't had a problem with it and it was super cheap so no complaints here!"
1,Great Volume & Sound !!: This is one of the best bluetooth mini devices on the market today. We've bought quite a few of these products as gifts as we've found great quality and function. And we all know this store sells them all for less than anywhere else.
1,Pretty good.: Seems to be made well. I'm a little nervous about the plastic parts but so far they have held up.  I hope I made a good choice. The price was nice!
1,"Junk: This is cheap scrap. It broke 10 minutes after first use. Remember, this is a carpentry tool. Do not be exposed to high pressure or high speed. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their precious bucks on this item."
1,"Badass: Liam Neeson - case and point.He is pretty much the only reason to watch this action movie. Its fantastic though, because its so realistic.LOVE it."""
1,"This is an action thriller, well suited to those who enjoy this type of movie. While I usually don't rush to see these, I really did enjoy this movie. The main character wins every fight, and hundreds of rounds of high powered ammo was shot at him without a single hit; so that was kind of like watching a Superman episode. But it was a good enough story and it was entertaining. The bad guys were so bad, and the hero was so unappreciated by his ex wife and daughter that the viewer had to root for him in every way ."

1,Great movie: This was a great action film. The acting was good and the action was great. Liam Neeson plays a very intelligent action hero who is concerned about his family. Highly recommended!
1,Great movie: action packed movie with great story. Especially since I have a daughter and I would probably do the same thing this guy did to get her back if I had to.
1,Great movie: Everything from plot to action to suspense was better than expected. The actor does a great job in this role.
1,"A metaphor: I think one reason that people love this book so much is that it's a deeply spiritual book. The meaning is something like, ""The unselfish love we give G-d is its own reward."" OK, that's not it. But something like that."
1,Extra Air Flow: I used these on a computer case that was small and upgraded the video card which generated a little more heat. I put this next to my video card and now my system runs a lot cooler.
1,This actor gives another great performance in this movie. The story did not have a single dull moment. It's one of those movies that you don't want to hit the pause button for any reason .
1,Excellent: This product is great - excellent and the DVDs are excellent. I really enjoyed this product and intend to buy more. I love music.
1,"Excellent headphones: really like these headphones! These headphones can isolate the sound well and you can turn the volume up high, very comfortable to wear. I didn't experience any discomfort like I did with previous headphones so this one was an all-round winner for me! And at a reasonable price - what a bargain!"
1,"I bought this product hoping for an alternative to the aluminum based ones normally used. It worked fine for wintertime when I only had desk work to do. However, with any amount of activity I found myself needing a deodorant."
1,"Works great, I can wear the same shirt twice !: This product works great !! I had been using a certain type of deodorant for years and suddenly it stopped working. The lady in the health food store recommended this new type and I'm really like it! Its smell lasts for a long time. I can wear the same shirt twice while keeping the smell fresh."
1,"What a great idea, easy to use at home and on the road! We had some problems initially with my 2-year-old daughter as she was strong enough to tear the paper napkins and the cloth napkins too. Once she found out that doing so was delaying her meal time, she stopped doing it. We bought these moisturizing wipes a couple of months ago and have really taken advantage of them a lot. It's really nice not to have to wash the bibs all the time. I am so happy that I bought two pieces."
1,"I was looking for a 3/4 '' hot air brush and finally found it. I hadn't tried this brand before, and it raised some suspicion in me as it was so inexpensive. But it turned out to be a great brush. Doesn't get tangled in my thin, medium length hair and dries it quickly without damaging it. I definitely recommend this brush.loved it ."
1,Great Introduction to Cooking: This cookbook will teach you how to make great dishes. Everything is very well explained and discussed. It teaches you how to make dozens of wonderful dishes instead of giving you so many recipes that one will never learn to make very well. I highly recommend it!
1,Great product.: We've actually had this item for a few years now. Never had a problem. Does everything and the quality to top notch.
1,Great Movie: It is hard to find a good clean movie that you can watch with your family. This is one to see. I have watched it a couple times and my daughter watched it every day during Christmas break. GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!
1,Very Very Good: I just love playing card games of all kinds and this is definately one of the easiest and funnest to play!!
1,Great size and good performance: We've been using this pot for a few weeks and are very happy with it. The bottom heats up evenly and is great for frying onions. It's large enough to make medium batches of soup and is a very reasonable size in a small kitchen. The handle stays cool.
1,BEST COOKWARE PANTS AND GREAT PRICE: Love these pans. I got this set as a wedding present last year. I love the kit very very very much - the pans heat up very quickly and clean beautifully. It is less expensive than many other sets and is great.
1,Overall a great book - especially the chapter on families. I recommend this book as a relatively comprehensive self-paced course.
1,"Quirky Romance: Very predictable but entertaining, light reading. Didn't take long to finish the book, so it held my attention and was a bit quirky."
1,"Great Story!: I really enjoyed this story. It was feel good, and I liked how the characters grew over time and became better people. To be honest, the ending was a little abrupt."
1,Love it: Love this product and all things from Cuisinart. I make a lot of soups and this pot is perfect. Heavy and good construction I would recomend to anyone......I also bought the Tri-Clad Cusinart Pots and Pans and couldn't be happier. I've always used just mismatched pots and pans and now have a beautiful set......Thanks to Amazon and Cusinart.
1,"It's good but it's a bit bulky: I've liked the pot and used it many times, the only problem is it's huge and the cleaning is a pain, the quality is good."
1,"Great pot.: I've only had this pot for a short time, but it's beautiful and large enough to accommodate large batches of soup, stock, curries, pasta sauce etc... Unlike many cheaper stockpots, this one feels very solid--not thin or flimsy--and the handles at the side of the pot make it easy to transport in spite of its large size."
1,"Loose laptop table: I think the manufacturer should have spent a little bit of material on the front parts that keep the laptop from slipping. It's a little shorter than the bottom of the laptop, which causes it to slide all the time. Every time I need to connect / disconnect wires or USB devices it slides down, sometimes it just slips on its own. Ten more millimeters make it perfect."
1,Works great: Stand works great. Minimal set up required. Has multiple levels so you can tilt your laptop at an angle most comfortable for you.
1,good buy too: The pan does what I expected - works very well I'm happyI did not give it 5 star because only the copper core types would make that grade -But I like it and would recomend it - the price is right.
1,This is a very strong frying pan that holds a lot more than I thought and distributes the heat very evenly. I will buy smaller pans too. Very satisfied.
1,"Absolutely terrible !!: I love this fryer !! I've been looking for a frying pan of this size for some time; When I found it, I was very excited to buy it. It's a great. I can easily prepare large quantities. When it comes to cooking, if you are as passionate as me, then it is very important that you have the right tools. I recommend this product to everyone !!"
1,"Heavy, Sticky: If you like really heavy pans that food sticks to and is hard to clean, this pan is for you."
1,"A solid buy: I just received my cookware recently so can't comment on its performance. However, its initial use has resulted in many notes: High quality wares. Every pot or skillet has great weight. The handle allows the bowl to be easily carried. Pots heat up very quickly. My primary interest in buying pots and pans is made of stainless steel. Some burning materials require soaking and scrubbing time to remove. Generally speaking, if you are willing to spend more time cleaning this is a very good product"
1,"Good range: For health reasons, I no longer want to cook with Teflon cookware. I found this set, read some reviews and hope for the best. All the pieces look great. The handles do not get hot during cooking. However, the cover handles get hot. The weight of this group is incredible. These pans are also easy to clean. Just place the pan in the sink with water and let it soak for a few minutes, then wipe it off right away."
1,excellent: these are all I was looking for in a set of cookware.easy clean up even when something sticks .give best performance.I would recommend these pans to anyone who enjoys cooking.
1,Love shiney pans: The ten piece set of Cuisinart pans arrived with shine and bright. Love that look...they work very well...a little stick here and there but the shine is gone...darn. Do I need to scrub a little harder...they are worth it. The weight of the pans seems to be just right...not too heavy but not light.
1,"Not happy with this purchase: I read most of the comments about this set and I see that the vast majority have nothing but cool things to say about it. However, I am not one of those lucky ones. I just bought this set and received it less than a week ago. I put the stove on medium heat and smoked the pan like crazy until it had a copper color that I can't remove. I cleaned and cleaned like crazy and managed to remove a layer of it, but the rest is from the pan itself. I am very disappointed that I purchased this set and wish I had read the negative comments a little more carefully before I spent my money on something that I thought was getting a good deal. Don't buy this set or you will be very disappointed!"
1,I have used this set of cookware since seven years . My husband and I are cooks and we have used them quite regularly. I have had no problems with the pans whatsoever. I can't recommend these enough.
1,"Good soap, but it smells bad, this is a good soap, but I wished that when I use it, it leaves a fresh scent on my skin."
1,"This kind of soap is hard to find, I love the great glycerine soap. It's getting harder to find. Glycerin soap cleans well and moisturizes without leaving a thin film on your skin."
1,Leather protector protects from scratches and drops. Really very good I will recommend it anytime.
1,"great pots and pans: These stainless steel pots and pans are great! It is good value for the money. I bought these for my college going son. I did not want to spend as much , but still wanted something that would last a while. He loves them. One thing he did mention is that the pot he uses for pasta got rainbow colored spots. I think that perhaps he used very high heat setting. I think that medium heat is all you need to use with this set. Overall, for look, price and performance, I would highly recommend this set."
1,"A great start with this high-quality cookware set: good quality. This was a substitute for another set of stainless steel. You'll get years, years, and years of use from this set."
1,"My first real cookware set: I bought this one based on other reviews, and I'm happy with my purchase. I feel more inspired and really look forward to cooking. This is a great alternative to more expensive brands, it heats up well, looks shiny and comes at a great price."
1,"I have some fryers that are over twenty years old, yet still clean sparkling as if they were brand new. If you need your own kitchen, or (especially) for something like a wedding gift or other special occasion, you will never go wrong with this set. People love to have it."
1,I loved this book !: I am a huge fan of this author - my only complaint is that she has not written any more books!
1,"Nice shirt, Great shirt, it is time for a new one due to stains, one of the few shirts I would buy again."
1,"This one is great!: is THE number 1 Sonic game! It's got great graphics, way past cool sound, and it actually has a plot."
1,"Very fun game: When my little brother told me how to play it, I became a fan of it, surprisingly educational game, increase kid's overall thinking skills. It's definitely better than the TV show."
1,This is a bright colored rug that looks very durable. My grandson has already spent hours pushing his cars with which he plays on this carpet. One of the most beautiful types of carpets.
1,"Gorgeous Rug - Good Fit - Soft, Non-Slip: I got this rug for my 2-year-old son because he's so obsessed with cars. The top is soft for the rug and the bottom has an anti-slip backing to keep it from slipping all over the wood floor. I'm happy with the size - not too big for a home, but big enough for a few kids to play without causing a fight. Good value for money, I think."
1,"Please do not waste your money! It arrived just in time, but was in horrible condition. The middle was curved. The left hook was also bent and did not fit the door. All pegs have black marks. Honestly, it looks as if this item has been used by someone else."
1,"Nice cookbook: The photography is beautiful and the recipes are so fun. It is a great gift for a chef. I loved it so much, I bought one for myself."
1,I received the DVD very quickly. It was purchased at a very reasonable price and arrived in good condition. The movie is very compelling.
1,DvD was transferred without incident. It proved to be playable on an existing DvD player and was very enjoyable to view.
1,"Awesome machine! Good customer service This coffee maker looks great! And it works great! I have used the espresso and coffee machine and am happy with both. I am not a connoisseur of coffee but I only prepare gourmet coffee from here and it works great. !!! I have received the machine and it was not working properly. Customer service was called in, and it turned out to be a defective part that was sent along with the unit. They immediately sent me a spare part."
1,"Good reliable product.: This product is very good and reliable. If batery is in good condition, the charging period is relatively short. When bateries are not in optimum condition, you will notice that charging time increase, so you should program for an on time replacement."
1,"The price is nice ""BUT"": I bought this coffee maker for the speed it claimed and the price.I will not make that mistake again.About every 30 minutes the element comes on to heat the water inside up and it gets louder every day,sounds like a jet engine after about a month.I will be reading reviews before purchasing another brand."
1,Cool back belt: I ordered this belt and picked it up very quickly. I was able to communicate with the customer service easily. I'm very happy with the belt and so is my back. The strap is easy to loosen or pull on quickly. I will buy again.
1,"These little up-lights that used to be so popuar are now hard to find. I use them to uplight a plant at the far end of the room and it works as a night lite, too. I used a smaller bulb than recommended. Very pleased."
1,wonderful book!: this book is an amazing tool. i wish i had it when my kids were young. now i use it to teach my grandchildren. i am also learning from it!
1,"We have had this for a couple of years, and it works just like it did on the first day. It's a great blender, easy to use and easy to clean. He is worth all the money. Much better than some of the cheap imitation plastic items we had before! It even has some great recipes included in it."
0,"Not worth the money: Unfortunately, this product is very flimsy and I'm not sure it will work on a daily basis. I was hoping to give it to my kids as storage but it's not worth the money. I wish I had better things to say."
1,"A breathtaking book!!: A gripping read! Once I started reading this page-turner, I couldn't put it down! Fascinating detail of one of the major events in history, and stunningly written.The best book I have read in ages."
1,"My son is entering his third year, I left nothing in my bag to train him. Posters, other videos, books, etc. I couldn't believe I'd find a toilet training video. The video is great: great songs, great moves. My favorite section is what to do if you have to go to the potty in a difficult place !!! My son loves it. This video is great, along with all the other technologies."
1,Best XML Book: This is an excellent book that introduces you to XML and how to use it in the real world. This book put aside my fears of not being able to grasp the complex topic and now I can talk about all about XML at cocktail parties! The book contains some basic review on HTML and then quickly takes you into the world of XML. Take a look at the table of contents and you'll see that the coverage is very complete. This book is well written and edited.
1,"An invaluable treasure for all ages: I found this book useful, informative and life-changing. The author writes in a cool, warm and readable style that is the perfect blend of personality and professionalism. Throughout the book, the author spells out clearly and precisely how to proceed and mistakes to avoid. My only complaint is that I didn't have this book when I was in college! I urge all college students to read this and refer to it often, because the knowledge and skills you will learn will help you not only in work but also in changing other areas of your life."
1,Amazing !: A wonderful book on the history of the pen. I found it in a library and wanted to own it. Amazing pictures and really great info on pens.
1,"Good ideas and bad presentation. I have been asked to purchase and use this book for the Oracle Database Design category. Although the authors have good experience and ideas about database design and implementation, they transmit their ideas somewhat poorly. They don't deal with the topics one by one, rather they jump from one idea to the next sometimes in one paragraph. This book contains good ideas, but one has to read this book many times."
1,"Great book, I really enjoyed it. I had to read it in an English class. At first I thought it would be difficult to read and stupid because of the accent, but when I read more of it, I found out it was cool and why it was on my Wanted Reading List. I would highly recommend reading this book to anyone who has not."

1,"Too difficult for beginners, it seems like this book is quite packed with some clever ideas, but it is too complicated for us beginners. I suggest you start with something simpler. This book is intended for game developers, and I gave it beginnings because it talks about creating games."
1,"A very much appreciated reference book: A friend of mine recommended this book to me a couple of years ago and it took me some time to find it in bookstores. After finding and reading it, I was totally amazed! Very full of information and advice, and easy to understand and humorous too. The design is excellent! I still haven't seen a good book like this one."
1,"The book provides a good introduction to networking basics in addition. It is well organized with lots of good examples. I learned most of the basics of network protocols from this book, which is a great and helpful book."

0,"I find it very difficult to understand how anyone can listen to this music, as a live musician and open-minded at the time, this music was the most terrible sound I had ever heard. People need to stop and remember what the true talent is, not this bad and uncoordinated singing group."
0,"This shaver was great for trimming my beard and mustache. I like to keep them at short length, like the length they'll be in after not shaving for a few days, and this shaver has a short enough adjustment for me. The device works smoothly. It doesn't pull any hair out, like some old trimmers, and the battery seems to last forever. I paid once when I bought it a few months ago, and it still works. Highly recommend it."
0,"Great trimmer, poor power, the razor is exactly what I want. It does a great job trimming my beard. However, I'm here less than two years after purchasing it and am looking for another trimmer. why? The battery has run out. Even worse, despite its description as ""wired / wireless,"" it only works wirelessly. The batteries are not replaceable. Yes I have followed the instructions for battery maintenance but nothing helps. . Does the manufacturer expect us to buy a new one of these products every 18 months?"
0,"Pretty much useless trimmer: Bought this based on the mostly positive reviews here after, it just died on me a few minutes ago, after about 2 months of use. It wasn't even that good of a trim anyways, I had to go over the same spots constantly; this was never a problem with my previous trimmer. I just ordered a new trimmer."
0,"If you are a fan of the original then be aware that this is completely different. The production isn't great, there's a lot of noise, and the chants tend to be a bit the same. However, there are some cool technical elements out there and some lovely tunes."
0,"I use this trimmer once a week. It is usually connected to electricity. In the middle of the trimming process, it randomly stops working. It's annoying."
0,It took three minutes for this shaver before I finished using it. She could barely have cut my face's rough hair even if I ran it on the same spot 20 times. The blades are simply too lackluster to be of any use to me. I advise not to own or buy it.
0,"Worst Trimmer Ever!!: This trimmer is horrible....it took me about 45 minutes just to get an even shave. If you have a really short beard then I suppose it will work fine for you. But if you have a beard around level 3 or higher, be prepared to stand there for at least half an hour trying to get an even shave."""
0,"Worst cookware ever. She has owned better cookware than before, costing under $ 15. This piece is useless. Everything sticks to it. Impossible to clean. I literally got rid of it after having it for 3 months."
0,"Worst router ever. Not working, always on limited or no connection 99% of the time. I live in a high stealing neighborhood so people always try to steal the signal and they pass, bad signal. Do not buy this router"
0,"The worst pot (cooker) I have ever bought. Everything sticks to the bottom and requires a long soak to loosen it enough to clean. After trying it six times on both the hob and oven, I cleaned it one last time and then never used it again."
0,"Bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the COMMENTS online; book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover , and say what a waste of money."
0,I bought a full set of cookware. It was expensive but I wanted something that lasted. After just two months of use the non-stick coating has deteriorated on all but two of the pans. You have taken good care of the cooking tools. I prepared four (very expensive) fryers. They will replace only one of the pans. They said I misused my cookware ... not right. I must say that the alternate pan worked very well. I will never buy cookware of this brand again.
0,"I bought this product but it didn't work properly for several months, I tried to reach technical support, but they were not able to solve the problem, return or change the product. I will never buy from this store."
0,I recently bought this product. Even with oil everything I cook in it gets really badly stuck. I threw it in a local dump.
0,"We bought the hair clipper with all attachments because it looked like the best deal. We definitely got $ 25 worth of using scissors. We used the scissors for about 7 haircuts and then the clipper head broke ... In the midst of the last haircut, the cheap screws broke on the inside and the head fell off. I tried to finish the haircut with scissors. If you are trying to cut your hair on your own then using scissors can be quite challenging, if you are looking for a cheap mini clipper kit then this is what you want. But, if you plan to use it regularly or for more than one person, I wouldn't recommend it. This machine can leave you with a half-clipped head."
0,"I am disappointed with this product. It lasts for 10-15 minutes in a perfumed machine, then disappears. I was expecting it to mix with the water and last as long as the water was in the device."
0,"I used to have the older version of this product, which is no longer available. Both versions have really weak batteries, but at least with the old version you could plug it in and it would operate off the AC directly. On this version, when the batteries die, you have to plug it in AND wait until the batteries recharge."
0,"I returned the watch because its appearance was very low-qualilty, shiny cheap gold! The photo and title  led me to believe that it was a burnished gold, but that it wasn't.It was too large for my wrist and was not adjustable. but I couldn't discern whether it was adjustable or not until I received it."
0,My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young.  I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again.
0,"The shaver is working fine, I charged it the first time I used it and it worked but the second time I used it went to charge it, the battery didn't charge. I've tried everything and properly pulled it off but I still can't figure out why it stopped."
0,"Disappointing shaver, the battery drains quickly, and it doesn't work while it's plugged in so if the battery drains you have to wait until it's fully charged to use it. Generally I do not recommend this product. I am looking for a new shaver now."
0,"The razor set combs are not sharp enough at the ends and feel like knives are pointed to your scalp (very painful), the blade adjusters are poorly designed and get stuck (sometimes the razor stops working when you adjust them), the whole set of blades has fallen off the shaver The first time I used it."
0,"Hope the battery lasts !: I've owned at least three of them in the past. Sometimes the cutout guard breaks, and other times the battery simply dies. I hope it lasts longer. It is working very well at the moment. I love it because it has so many length changing settings."
1,"It is without doubt one of the most skillful, lively and influential novels in the English language. The novel itself is characterized by profound honesty and humanity - it contains the best characters I have ever encountered. The plot is very simple (the most important incident in the book falls on the first fifty pages), yet its message is beautiful, wise and sad. This is by no means a perfect novel, but a masterpiece in its own right."
0,"For the amount of shipping I paid for this, you would think it would be shipped in something other than an envelope. To top it off, it didnt even really cost that much to ship. All that was on it was a normal stamp. I would not buy this again."""
0,Disappointed: I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed. This product had GREAT reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots. Unfortunately it did nothing for me.
0,"I honestly don't know how this novel became a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to read this book and I only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in the club who was disappointed. It was a miserable and useless story. It was a great description of life during that time period, but the heroine never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give her two stars instead of one."
0,"Too slow to use. I bought this device on competitive products due to the price. But the file copying process takes a long time. When I called technical support for the company producing the complaint, they claimed that this is not a defect, but the problem is in its design! This seems unacceptable to me."
0,"After three more than five hours of conversations with hard-to-understand customer service representatives, they told me something I had bought from them was broken. Then they told me it was defective. The money spent is a great deal on such garbage."
0,"a father's death provides focus to everyday issues such as family interactions, society views, childhood mockery, etc."
0,"It stopped working in less than a year: The razor worked fine for about eleven months, and met with regular use. But her fall stopped her from working. Beware and take good care of this product if you decide to purchase it. They do not make warranties on this product for a reason."
0,"Battery Problems with 3+ Trimmer: Tried 3 trimmers  for 3 years . Every time, after 4-6 months of use, battery stops holding charge and have to charge 24 hours everyday for a 2 min usage. Put 25 more bucks and get a Braun. trust me, you wont regret."
0,All slots in the credit cards wallet are too small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to easily insert the cards.

0,"good size, difficult to assemble: The size of this toy box is great! It holds plenty. I like that there are no small screws and bolts and it will not squeeze small fingers. To be honest it was a pain to assemble. Trying to put plastic pieces into slots and then to line them up took two of us."""
0,"Sad. Terrible.: I was required to read this book for school, and found it throughly depressing. Its a series of short stories about teen immigrants, most of which end in sadness. Don't buy unless you like depressing stories."""
0,Big Mistake: Did a big mistake buying this item. It would have been better if i had ordered my previous trimmer from Philips.
0,Big disappointment: This trimmer stops charging after a few months. It won't work .. a useless piece of junk.
0,"Novel Death in the Family: No wonder, this is not a useful topic. However, this is one of the most surprisingly written novels truly based on facts. Cool and fun!"
0,"not enough calories: This looked great at first... but then I started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes. Most of the Main Dishes have less than 200 calories, some have less than 100. I don't have time to cook and eat 8-10 meals per day."
0,"Bad Company - Equipment Unimportant: I bought the unit new - I took it home and set it up. It lasted a day before it broke. Then I paid for the recharge to fix it, and after charging it to fix it and then calling the company after hearing nothing for more than two weeks, I find they still need the receipt I sent with the unit. So I gave them that and they brought back the unit. It didn't last even a day. So I pay again to recharge them so they can try to fix it. I cannot say how disappointed I was about this unit and the company itself. This is my first and last experience with them. It would be better to spend your money somewhere other than this company."
0,"I was very disappointed with the book. The premise is interesting enough, the characters are kinda cute and the plot is esoteric. I kept trying to get into the story, but it failed to gain my attention at any time. I tried to give each class a new opportunity to get my interest, but it was like trying to find the right key to unlock the door from among a set of keys in a medallion."
0,"Blades come off too easily!: I have to agree with the user above. This trimmer has nice features and accessories, but the unit itself is cheaply made. I bought this model, because I was pleased with the previous model. Unfortunately though, I had to throw it out as the blade assembly kept falling off. The trimmer is very cheaply made. Avoid this product!"""
0,"Food is stuck in the pan, cleaning is very difficult, it's only good for boiling eggs. This is really a piece of junk. Everything sticks to the fryer when I cook .. it should be disposed of and not sold on amazon."
0,"Useless: If you want a good razor, be prepared to spend more than $ 30. This thing barely cuts out, can't handle charging, and it's loud. To give you an idea of ??what to expect - two weeks ago the battery ran out in the middle of shaving, which was probably the second or third time I used it. Today I needed a little trimming and guess what happened, I couldn't finish shaving this time either. This thing is completely useless."
0,"I knew in chapter 3 that I wasn't going to like the book, but I always try to finish and hope something comes back to recover the book. There is no such luck. If you are looking for a good book to read, choose another one, as this book will get you tired and tiring."
0,The battery life of this product is worthless. It's been running out of a month to use and it won't last despite keeping it plugged in for hours. Drains in less than a minute. I do not recommend buying it.
0,"This device worked for a while, but after trying to make a backup, the admin password didn't work anymore, many attempts to access data, reset password, contact tech support, upgrade firmware, etc., fix the problem didn't work . Poor tech support: You wait too long, then they often blame you. I finally gave up."
0,"Satisfied Customer: As always, I'm happy with Amazon's service. The product arrived and was conveniently prepared."
0,"When things in my life seem so difficult, I read this wonderful story, and I realize that I can overcome any problem with the same determination that the heroine and her family showed. All the characters were good, from the strong-willed mother to the loving aunt, the heroine was able to overcome the adversities in her life. She learned from everyone around her and the harsh environment in which she lives. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves aging stories."
0,"Unreliable !: This product worked fine at first, but after less than three weeks, one of the ducts stopped altogether, and none of the many things I tried had returned it. There appears to be some quality control issue."
0,Junk: Blade assembly fell off after one use. There is no information available on how to fix it. A frustrating nightmare. Do not buy this junk.
0,Bloody Awful: I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character.
0,"Very good movie, this movie started a bit slow at first, but picked up its power shortly thereafter. Not a bad movie, it had a lot of twists, it's very hard to guess the real bad characters in this movie."
0,"Two years ago, I brought it and I liked it. I drink coffee in the morning, so I only use it once a day. After a few months of bringing it in, the heating plate began to rust. I kept using it for an additional six months when the heating plate was exposed to 50% rust. I thought it was an accident, so I threw it away and brought the same model over again. After nine months, 20% of the hot plate is rust .... this time I don't think it's an accident."
0,This company used to make good trimmers but now the trimmers are so cheap that they are more likely to remove your hair than to cut it. Their customer service is awesome.
0,"Good book . The most important sections of this book: cognitive learning, values, culture, goals, working with tools, and communication. The charts and tables in this book are almost completely useless. There are some really good ideas here, but there are a lot of unnecessary things to be aware of."
0,Great book for everyone: I didn't think anger was a real problem for me until I got married. This book showed me some powerful principles about how to understand and deal with my anger in a constructive rather than destructive way.
0,"Useless book, not worth the time or money. It teaches you how to write letters, but provides no exercises except for reading animal sounds, snakes and ladders, and word searches. It also gives cultural notes. There is another book that is much better."
0,A book not suitable for beginners at all. It's badly written and jumps from topic to topic. It makes no sense at all. It presents the tags and symbols without any explanation and then jumps into more code with information never explained. Do not buy it. Save your money and time
1,"A perfect book in many ways, about death in the family that is devastating and heartbreaking. Anyone who has suffered a terrible loss experiences many emotions and may not know how to express them. This book is a way to express it with precise terms and precise notes. I was struck by the prose, meticulous use of words, economy of sentences and attention to important details."
0,Everything sticks to it !!!: This fryer is not worth the money. Every time I use it I lose a lot of what I cook due to the stickiness in it and it has to soak in hot water for hours for it to be cleaned. Not a good frying pan. A bad frying pan is tiring.
0,Every recipe I've tried so far has been either bland or totally gross. I need to get rid of this book before I waste more time and money on disastrous recipes. The book is a waste of money - beyond buying and shipping costs.
0,"I was expecting something different: the music is way too loud for me, but I'm going to send it to a friend who likes that kind of thing."
0,"I've been using this trimmer as my main shaving tool since I bought it about a year and a half ago, and I use it once a week on average. I was so happy even a few weeks ago, when I ran out of energy every time I shaved. The battery will not hold its charge after the first 24 hours after charging. The problem is that the razor does not work when plugged in. So basically, every time I want to use the razor, I have to charge it at least half an hour in advance, which makes it unusable for me."
0,"Was quite happy with this razor for about 4 months. Then the battery started dying, slowing lasting for shorter and shorter time periods. Eventually it just stopped holding a charge at all. And on top of that, the plug doesn't supply enough power to use the razor, so it's pretty much junk now. Disappointing."
0,No one in my class liked this text. If you knew nothing about disaster mental health topics than it may be helpful.
0,"I don't understand why this novel is so appreciated. To me it is just boring and boring. I especially do not like the fact that it is said that the novel is incomplete. These unfinished pieces are weird and confusing. I totally hate reading it, but I have to admit that she has some advantages in her exploration of how children and humans deal with unexpected death."
0,"I do not recommend this toy container. Capacity is huge, very difficult to assemble. One of the pieces holding the two sides together broke in an attempt to hold it in place because I was unable to pull the pieces together enough. I emailed the company and they immediately sent out free replacements. I assembled it at the end using a strap to pull the pieces close enough to insert the connectors. However, I noticed the protrusion of a conductor two days ago."
0,"Do not buy this book if you consider yourself any smart. It contains a lot of trivial diagrams and what can be explained in just a sentence often occupies a dozen pages. This makes the book very boring to read and impossible to use as a reference. It also does not cover anything except foundations, although the table of content looks very impressive."
0,"Nothing innovative for wrestling specifically: I am a wrestling coach and father of three boys who love the sport. I was looking for a book to give wrestlers an edge over their competitors. What I found in this book was nothing new for anyone with any kind of experience with weight training. It contains some helpful information, and for someone looking to educate themselves about weight training for wrestling, football or other similar sports, this book will definitely help. But I was looking for something more creative and specific in wrestling. I was disappointed."

0,"I have received a Mattress air mattress that does not contain an air pump and it was not in brand new condition, and a ""manual"" states that there is no warranty.

We will investigate the situation and address it with the item however, we cannot guarantee when the error can be fixed."
0,"I bought this shaver for my friend because he's lazy about keeping up with shaving his beard. It worked great at first, but after 4-5 uses over a period of 4-5 months it stopped working. It lasts about 5 seconds of use then shuts off, and you can't use it while plugged in. Too frustrating."
0,"I purchased this print server about 5 years ago, and it was an endless source of frustration for me. I had to put it back right away because it was wrongly described as the only print server that works with MFPs. I knew there was no print server that could work with a scanner, besides other problems. The worst that I saw, as a matter of fact. Misery of fate."
0,"You received this trimmer as a gift. After one month, do not keep the shipment. I plugged it in for several days and it still looks dead the moment I start using it! Don't waste your money on this unwanted piece."
0,"I got this fryer a couple of years ago, but am very disappointed with it. The pan is rusty orange and has a rough surface. It also changes color. Not worth buying."

0,"I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details. On several occasions I noted incorrect grammar in the book, and even misspellings! Never before have I seen such a poorly written book. I do not recommend this book."
0,"This book was not very helpful, this book is the same one that I studied in school. Everyone, including the teacher, found it nearly impossible to learn from this book. We used it for exercises and examples only."
0,"Not good !!: I haven't used the product up to three times. stop working. I paid $ 30 for this thing and want my money back. I will contact the manufacturer to inform them of this product. It's a cool piece, but it doesn't hold the chargefor long."
0,Great shaver but the battery runs out fast! After a few months with minimal use the battery is no longer charged so now I have to get rid of it. I'm sick and tired of this stupid approach to making products - make a poor product and sell it cheap so people can buy it every 4 months. I'd rather pay more for a better product so that I don't contribute to polluting the earth.
0,"Pathetic, it's really hard to believe how bad this book is. You can prove this is the worst novel to ever win these two awards. . The novel is boring, boring, unimaginative, not interesting. The culture that the author created in this book is not interesting, incredible, and does not even deserve the paper it is printed on."
0,"Disappointing at best: the book falls short of a good work. Honestly, I can find better images and design in magazines than I find in this book. It's easy to understand why so many people want to sell their copies. It's really frustrating if you are used to really inspiring design posts. If you decide to buy this book, do yourself a favor and buy a used copy. Even at Amazon's low price, it's still way higher than what you get."
0,"Heartbreaking, totally touching depiction of death. The characters are beautifully simple people and because their lives are so ordinary, it is easier for the reader to sympathize with their loss. I'm not sure ""Death"" is what you would call a ""great novel"", very few events, but it is ""wonderful writing"" and it always strikes a chord."
0,Please do not purchase this book thinking you will enjoy reading it. it's not like that. It is dull and dry. Think of it as a reference book that is only referenced occasionally when an ambiguous fact or statistic is needed.
1,Death in the Family: This is one of my favorite books and I find myself giving copies to people I know who have lost a loved one. This book came in good condition and in a timely fashion. My only comment is that the shipping charges are almost the same as the price of the book!
1,"This book is wild, fascinating, and blatantly honest: If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have had one book with me, I would have chosen that book. It irritates me, grieves me, insults me, and rejoices in me. But most of all, it inspires me. Each time I read it, I discover something unique and precious. If you really like and can appreciate the serene beauty of the wilderness, buy it, read it."
0,This is misleading! Although it is listed as compatible with iPhone it is not! Wish someone either fixed their product claims or stopped selling the wrong (old) version of the product.
0,This pan is too heavy for me. I prefer a 12 inch long topped deep fryer.
0,"Absolute nonsense: I've never read such a poor science fiction book in my life, and I don't know what planet most other reviewers are. The book is poorly written about very poor content. Boring boring boring boring. I lost confidence in the awards of this institution after reading this trash."
0,"Good functions, bad battery: I bought this trimmer 18 months ago. The functions are great for trimming your beard and mustache, but after only 18 months, the battery will not continue to charge for more than a week or two. There's nothing quite fun like getting to the middle of your beard trimmer before you go to work in the morning and running out of battery halfway!"
0,"According to Amazon's description, this charger works wired or wirelessly. According to the manual, the cord only works to recharge the battery. If the battery is running out, you cannot use it even with the cord. Also according to Amazon's description, this features a washable design. According to the manual, you should not rinse under water. But once charged, and kept clean with the included brush, it does a good job of trimming and shaving."
0,"I like its shape, and it fits well with my beard, but the battery dies off after about 48 hours. And since I need it every morning before going to work, it's useless unless I remember charging it the night before."

1,Love these nappies - they don't leak. I love them and use them exclusively for our baby at night (he trains during the day) and I have absolutely no problems. They are easy to wear and are great to use. I have tried many brands and these definitely work the best. I highly recommend these nappies.
1,"Love it ... it's cool ...: It's one of the best books I've ever read. I was forced to read it to school. She is a very strong woman and I love the way she gets what she wants. She's not afraid to make a sacrifice or two to get things her way, even though I don't like the way she ditches her kids all the time ..."

1,"Good performance and small scale, I have no complaints about this modern and well designed toaster oven, other than that it is a bit smaller than I had hoped."
1,"Great Learning Tool for Kids !: I bought this book in 2003 for my 13-year-old nephew. His mother taught him his body parts using the official language, not colloquial. It was a great book for him, as kids love picture books. He looked at him and read more and more as he got older. He already knew a lot of the information inside the book; However, there is a difference in hearing than there is in vision."
1,Good beard trimmer: This is a good shaver also. A bit to big. holds a charge for a long time and has sharp blades.

1,"I give this book three excellent marks! It's touching, funny, sad, romantic, and scary at the same time! It's a classic that keeps readers ready for millions of years!"
1,"Best Garden Tool: I love this one. Its blade has scale marks to help define the distance between plants. The edges of the blade are sharp allowing me to chop the roots of young trees as well as open compost bags. The protective sleeve that comes with it looks cheap, but it helps to store the tool when not in use. I have attached a brightly colored ribbon to the handle to make it more visible when I put it on, and I will give this as a gift to friends or family who work in the garden."

The stories are rendered in black and white, but it doesn't matter because the quality of the stories is classic.

1,"Great Calculator - Need a Better User's Guide: It's the most powerful non-graphing calculator I've used. It's ideal for non-mathematics students who have to attend middle college algebra class. Unfortunately, the single instruction sheet is not sufficient for the type of student who will benefit from it the most."
1,"Excellent price calculator: I bought the HP 33S last year for the sole purpose of taking an exam. I have been using HP Calculators for over 20 years and I felt very comfortable with it; However, the 33S was a disappointment to me, for one reason, which is the blurring of the decimal point, so 33.457 looks like 33457, that little thing kept me from using the 33S, so I went and bought a casio -, what a calculator !!! Lots of functionality, ease of use, the numbers are huge, and don't forget the decimal point, I can really see it. I think I'll buy another one as a backup."

However, I ordered two of the same product, they were shipped at the same time and when they arrived, they were two different colors. If it doesn't bother you, then you're good to go. If so, you may want to consider ordering from someone else. As for the price, I didn't bother to return them, but you can try to contact the seller."

1,"Simply put, this calculator has the best performance compared to the available price. Although many schools focus on using other types, I found that I had an easier time having students with other types due to my direct computer interface. I highly recommend this calculator, it's easy to use, and it's fast to draw."
1,"My 4-year-old daughter loves it !: This book focuses on the people, climate, history, food and culture of the Andes. It is not a ""fast"" book to read, as it delves into children's books. I thought the long paragraphs and depth of information would be too much for her four-year-old, but I was wrong. She is fascinated by the book and the pictures and loves to read it over and over again, and I learned with my daughter."

1,"Writing a lesson plan is easy and so is this book: this book, while helpful and a good start, is far too simple to be really helpful. I expected more from the book than I actually got. While it makes writing the scholarship seem easy, unfortunately there is nothing real for the book. I was a little disappointed in the book when I received it that day. However, it does have some great word lists that are helpful for writing; To better convey your meaning, it has some good infographic to help you plan."

1,"Lightweight and easy to use. After reading the various reviews about it, it became clear that the beard trimmer itself was what I really needed. I bought a razor and used it for several months. How happy I am with her. Very light weight, and easy to hold. I wish I had known about it for years. I took it out of the box with a charged battery and it was ready to use, which is something I don't think I've come across before. I'm very happy, and I think it's great for the price."
1,"Other reviewers mentioned that this chair doesn't support the back and they were right. It's really uncomfortable after a few hours. If the back is adjusted forward, then it will be a great chair. Very nice looking with high quality materials. But it is not comfortable for long periods of time on the computer."
1,"Awesome !!!: This is the best ""kid"" book I've ever read. From the miracle of pregnancy to the day of the birth, this is the most amazing and educational book that I have enjoyed reading.

1,"Great buy: I've always loved Casio calculators for being cheap, very reliable, and durable. This machine contains a two-line display, in addition to a large number of functions ranging from statistics to those that suit the needs of a middle school student to the college student. And the solar panel means you won't have a dead calculator for homework or exam, but the battery lasts for at least 2 years anyway."
1,"Excellent buy, I love this chair. It is very comfortable, moves easily and I can sit on it for long periods of time without any problems."
1,"Great deal for the money: My old razor broke, so I need a new one quickly. I used the promotion and received it the same day! . After a quick charge and 5 minutes of grooming, I looked great again. The razor is strong enough to make shaving easy and not pull hair at all. I'm very happy with it, the money and the delivery speed."
1,"GREAT PICTURES !!: I received this book as a gift after finding out I was pregnant. The pictures were great and the information was very helpful. My only disappointment is that 3/4 of the book is for the first 12 weeks. (I didn't receive it until I was 14 weeks old) It's still amazing to see what my baby looked like as he developed, but I wish the later months were a little more elaborate."
1,"Amazing Pictures !: I bought many books for my pregnant wife, and this book contains the most amazing pictures! The book displays many digitally reformatted pictures of spinal cord development, genes, brain, skin, ears ... well the entire anatomy!

Please consider purchasing this book for a pregnant woman."

This is a handbook for managers, lawyers, and health science professionals who need a quick revitalization as quickly as possible."
1,"When I rented a house we found this recording on the CD player when we arrived. Now it's part of our evening ritual when we're sitting on the balcony watching the gorgeous sunsets - great music I had hoped was on Amazon - so I could get copies for my friends who have beach houses. It's comfortable, but it's not boring - I can't describe it better than that."
1,"My new FAVORITE FACE WASH!: The title says it all! This is hands down the best face wash I've ever encountered. Light, mildly fragrant, and deep cleansing. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized."
1,"Not safe at all !!!: I tried exactly what this book was told to do; Cut calories and exercise every day, and now after one week, I can barely walk; My muscles are in severe pain in them, this guy never tells you that to get less than 20 grams of fat per day, you need to eliminate almost all dairy products, or that your body needs to rebuild muscles after a workout!"
0,"Not Very Happy: I ordered this cologne for my friend for Christmas. Two weeks later, I received an email from Amazon saying that my transaction was canceled without any explanation as to why. When I got back to the item on Amazon, it was still available but the price went up by about $ 20. As far as if the product is in stock, it shouldn't be a problem. So now I have to find this cologne in stores because it's too late to ship it in time for Christmas. I am very pissed off and urge anyone considering buying from them to shop elsewhere. There are tons of perfume wholesale companies online with better business methods than these."
1,"This back brush is what I've been looking for for a long time. The other brushes I tried were too soft or spongy which quickly deteriorated or fell off the handle. This brush is a good, tough brushing brush that can reach all those places on my back that I can't reach, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to feel clean."
1,"Good idea, good looking, needs a lot of work: I recently bought an eMarker from Sony. It shows how far the technology has come, and it also shows how useless some of the technology referred to. Needless to say, his classy elegant look attracts a lot of attention. The main problem is its lack of very useful features. Hope Sony does some reviews and releases a better, more useful product as we expected from them."
1,"GREAT GIFT IDEA: I bought these as a gift for my mom and girlfriend daughters everyone was happy! The flavors are varied and all delicious. It took me back to my youth when I first used it, it's such a great lip balm."

1,"Wonderful inflatable boat, this boat has been with me all over the world. It's durable, lightweight, easy to put on, and paddles like a dream. Why rent boats for your trips? Buy it and take it with you, even if you have to pay an extra price."
1,That was true! And definitely useful. Teens will find encouragement because someone has taken the time to explain all those confusing changes they're going through.
1,"This book was a gift, so I cannot comment it, but knowing Amazon.com from past purchases for myself, I have no question it is good.The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Wrestling."
1,"A book that keeps you guessing until the end. It is very short and easy to read, and considering the book is short and contains 1000 words of vocabulary, it feels a bit cramped. It is well written and more fun."
1,"Good book but there are a large number of resources online, solid book, but I recommend Youtube to anyone wanting to learn how to code."
1,Good book: Good story and interesting characters..A lot of history in this story that I found to be interesting..the life of Indians has always fascinated me.
1,"Great book, bad binding: I love the pictures in this book and I definitely recommend them. If you've ever wanted to see what's going on out there and you're not happy with an inconspicuous ultrasound (who is it?) This is the book for you! It's great to see how a child grows. I wish it was organized a little differently. There seems to be some kind of manufacturing problem with it that the pages break when you turn them over as it pulls off the white glue in the casing and will eventually fall off. I'm going to return the book for a replacement, but there seems to be a lot of problems with a lot of these books, so I'm not entirely sure the same won't happen with replacement. Therefore, I may not wish to gift it as the gift recipient may be embarrassed to try to figure out how to return a defective product."
1,"Wonderful book, good condition: Love the book! I read it in 5 days. The condition of the book is as declared by the seller. I recommend it to other people."

1,"Great cookbook: I bought this book for my hubby who cooks. Unable to purchase a cookbook, I searched Amazon and bought a cookbook. He was very happy because the recipes were for preparing many dishes in which he wanted to gain more experience."
1,"Amazing book: I first saw pictures from this book in use in a magazine in 2002 or so, and I knew I had to own this book. The photography techniques are incredible. What sets this book apart from the other fetal growth books I've seen is the use of technology to isolate images of developing organ systems. For example, you will not only see a fetus at 58 days of pregnancy, but you can also see a stomach, heart and skeleton. . I really acquired this book about the miracle of human evolution in a way we've never seen before."
1,"A very practical guide to using web design without pain and effectiveness. This is a useful book that answers difficult and intuitive questions that no one else knows. For example, what is the best way to make your text look good on the Internet. Read What is the best unit of measure for text? Once you read this book you will know. If you are a beginner or intermediate web designer, this book is right in your specialty. Don't miss taking your talent to the web it's a classic story from a wise man."
1,A BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC: This book is a beautifully written account of life and death in the early 1900s as seen through the eyes of a young boy. It is almost lyrically the way it is written. The portraits of the characters are so sharp that the reader feels he knows them closely. This book is a true classic book useful to read.
1,"I needed some beginner gardening tools like a shovel and other things. A friend sent me a garden knife. Looks great and works well, it can dig, break up soil, cut roots buried in place with a serrated or straight edge, and even have a gauge if you want to be very precise about planting depth. If you think you might like it, buy it. Great handy tool. It's not just a hand digger - it's a hand digger with really sharp edges on the sides."
1,I needed this calculator for my math class in college and I am also planning to be an engineer and this calculator is one if not the most advanced calculator that you can get for certain engineering certification exams. It has a lot of great features and the build quality is good ... Very happy with the purchase.
1,Classic comedy: I really miss this guy. Funny man. This must be the first CD he released. I need to find more of his material.
1,"Strong cable - the one I needed: I previously bought a shorter cable, but it wasn't as durable as this cable. It stopped working completely in less than a year. I am happy with this cable, as it is of better quality and build."
0,"Not Worth Buying: After seeing this book a few years ago, I was expecting something of better quality now. Instead, the book sounds more intimidating. Maybe the pictures are too big? Not real enough? The book does not contain the information I want, and almost nothing is explained in the text either."
0,Don't Buy This Book: I was very disappointed with this purchase. Pictures in the book were not focused. The colors weren't sharp. I do not recommend this book.
0,"Not to worry: this book is the biggest waste of time in my 10 years of romance reading. I was disappointed. . Based on her previous novels, I consider her an outstanding author and I have no problem purchasing her books. I definitely wasted my money on this novel. Please, don't bother."
1,"I got this calculator for school. I don't have any shared readings on the calculator. It's cool, but the box opened from the top. There was nothing wrong with that, but I didn't understand it yet."
1,"I have read all the previous comments on this toaster oven from multiple sites. All I can say is my wife absolutely loves this machine. From my limited use I find it easy, wonderful and practical to use !!! Trust me ... I advise you to buy it !!!"
1,"I had a solar calculator before, and wanted a new one for any type of sports tour. This calculator is good, and cheaper than other models, I have had a little bit of confusion with the memory usage, which doesn't work like other timers. But just read the guide to understand it."
1,"I found it sexy and good. Dialogue, ambiguity is weak: You liked the book very much, it could make you enjoyable, good dialogue, and interaction between lovers, a little weak in mystery."
1,"I haven't looked at this book in fifteen years ... but it is one of the few books I've read in my life that has been ""magic"". The story really puts you in the shoes of some heroic, but very frightened characters that are attacked by incredibly frightening alien monsters. I'll have to go back and read it again to see if it still contains ""magic"" for me. No. I'll leave it as a great childhood memory that has never been spoiled."
1,"Absolutely amazing: I just wanted to write my own comment and say how amazing this book really is. It's a perfect blend of information and pictures. It clearly states that most of the photos are not real photos, but rather a combination of photos and art. Some reviewers bother with this. I don't think the author is trying to fool anyone into thinking these are actual photos. The author simply tries to allow the reader to better visualize the amazing process that takes place in a mother's womb. Since it is almost impossible to obtain actual images of a fetus, this is the closest we can get. Still pictures are amazing. I look at it every day and it makes me appreciate more of the miracle of birth and life. This is a must book for all expectant mothers. It can also be a perfect gift for mom."
1,"Amazing, simply amazing, I bought one razor a year ago. There are no obstacles to cutting facial hair. Very cool product ... no battery! Leave it plugged in ... use it ... plug it back in ... cool cool simple."

1,"Excellent: An incredible device! I am amazed at its quality. My son uses it every day for his photography club. Fits the camera. We're excited that my son is expanding his focus on such fine art by using these old cameras and technologies, instead of doing something else. If my son learns to properly develop the movie."
1,"The actor is good, the movie could have been a lot better. The scenery and costumes were great, but she left the same scenes wanting more beautiful and cool things."
1,"Best book ever: This book is the amazing story of a young girl who grew up in poverty, but so vibrant with life. Dynamic images, character development. I've read it over and over and still love it. I would recommend it to anyone from high-ranking fourth grade readers to seniors. What a great story!"

0,"Old but good stuff, I finally found it. I've been searching for it for a long time now, and I'm still looking."
0,"I thought this book would be excellent because it has been written by many famous programmers. But the book teaches you the old tricks that many know about in Flash 4, but now we have Flash 5! A book is futile."
0,"I thought it would be a good novel. You are not. The story goes on and on without a specific direction. I could barely read until the end, and when I did, I was very disappointed."
0,"The best thing is the scroll wheel - one click and you can virtually go to the end of the document. However, you are still trying to find a compatible surface with it. Mouse does not work on most surfaces. Works Slowly on paper, little fast on glossy plastic."

0,"I love the raw (raw) almonds and I like the price of these almonds, but the bag I got didn't taste good at all. There was no fresh almond flavor, whether raw or roasted in the oven. Almond quality was old, not rotten, but not fresh either. More than 85% remains in the bag, and I will neither eat nor use it."
0,"I am a big fan of this author. However, it was a big disappointment. The plot was vulgar and weak. The hero and the heroine were boring. This book is definitely not the best work of the author. But I am still a fan."
0,"It's misleading: Product details lead you to believe that you are only getting three brochures, but only one. The other two are instructions on one page folded to look like a booklet. The main booklet is not the same as the original and it is written in five or so languages ??which makes reading the instructions (in your language) more difficult."

0,"A complete waste of money: I can't believe this is still being served, this book is such a waste of time. It looks like a bunch of old notes wrapped around a red envelope and overpriced."
0,After two months I found out that it had stopped working. This item is completely unreliable. Today it will only work if it's within 25 feet of the transmitter. This thing is clearly unimportant and unhelpful to me. Hope I can find one that really works.
0,"After ordering the painting was shipped immediately. We installed it in the room. Keeps the room warm during cold weather. But before winter arrives the unit has stopped working, I'll rate it with 1 star because it didn't last more than 60 days."

0,"Smelly soap, the soap smelled very good inside the box, but when I lathered the soap to wash my face, the scent seemed to change and it wasn't perfectly pleasant. The manufacturer needs to really upgrade their products for a better rich and long-lasting fragrance with better moisturizers."
0,"Decent and fine soap, but not a miracle of leather, definitely not worth the price. It didn't leave my skin feeling soft, but it works well as an antiseptic. But other types of soaps smell much better."
0,A mild soap as advertised but its mild fragrance is so bad that I'll throw it away. I have never been told that I smell bad except when I take a shower with this soap.
0,"I ordered the unsalted almonds once before, and they weren't tasty. Pre-ordered foods were sweeter, had more nutty flavor, and were more chewable (and not dry). I think these are tasteless, flavorless because they've been sitting on a shelf for too long (like tea leaves lose their flavor over time)."

0,"As other reviewers have mentioned, they have had issues playing DVDs. I bought this for my father. They were so passionate that I hooked it up and spent hours trying to get it to work. As for the price, I wasn't expecting the high-quality sound or picture, but at least I expected it to work. I have to give my money back not just for the cost of this discarded piece but the time I spent trying to get it to work properly."
0,"I was really expecting this heater to be great but it failed for me. It might be good for a room the size of a small closet, but it didn't do anything for my bedroom. It is really a waste of money for me."
0,"I needed a headphone, and I got these. After two weeks it stopped working, the microphone is now dead. However, when it works it has great sound quality, and my ears don't hurt."
0,I can't believe the amount of problems and headaches I have been trying to use this product after a 15 day trial period. Why is there a trial period for a product I have purchased. It's a stressful process. Do not use this product !!!!!
0,"Unfortunately, my daughter needed to read this book before school starts . We started reading it last week and discovered that there are about 14-18 pages that are blank. The print quality  is poor. I'm hoping as we go through the book we can figure out what is missing so that she can complete the book report that is due the first day of class."
0,"We have been using these phones for a few months and they are horrible phones if there is any sound or noise around the desk the headphone will pick it up and you won't hear anything. We are currently looking to replace these phones. """
0,I bought this item as a gift and was upset to discover that the last 25 pages were blank and that there are no publisher page or footnotes. Was this book a typo? I think it's a bad buy.
0,"I bought this mouse to replace my wireless mouse, while it is a comfortable mouse, it does have transmission issues (wireless), or stopping issues, the buttons do not respond to movement until I shake it, or move the mouse to a different area. At first I thought it was my problem, or that my desktop was too bright. Now I am convinced that the problem is in the mouse."
0,"I bought this watch thinking I wouldn't be buying another watch for too long, but it wasn't the case! The next day after wearing the watch, I noticed the strap was severely scratched. The coating came off very easily, and although the scratches don't affect the performance of the watch, it makes looking at it quite horrific ... and if I can bring this watch back, I'll do it in a moment. I highly recommend buying something different! """
0,"We purchased this heater, and installed it according to the instructions. It worked great for 3 or 4 weeks. Then one night, we woke up to a burning stench. It was coming from the stove. The other side of the heating unit was turning black and smoky. We disconnected the heater and removed it immediately. It took about two weeks before the chemical stench left our room. Please do not buy this product."
0,"I have waited several weeks for a copy of New Masters of Flash and am so frustrated. It was cheaply produced, clumsily written, and perhaps worst of all. You cannot read menu names, or gain any useful idea of ??how the effects are built. Long and completely blurry. Complete disappointment."
0,I've had this computer for about a week. It is a great machine. The only drawback I see is that the hard disk sound is too loud. It looks like he's grinding all the time.
0,The description of this book prompted me to believe and expect more than what I got. Tons of great names but little to no content. I was very disappointed to see him.
0,"I saw this trophy on a show. The only complaint I have is that it will leak if it is turned upside down. Keeps heat and cold well. It also does not ""spoil"" the taste of the drinks like some lined metal cups. All in all, I love this cup."
0,"We missed countless visitors at the door because we could not hear around the house! This was an easy to install and great way to extend the sound of the doorbell! In addition, you can choose the type of sound that is sent into the rooms. . Just plug it into electrical outlets in any room that needs it."
0,"I have met the author. She's a terrible person and nobody should buy her book. Nothing to admire. In short, she is evil. Don't buy her book because I don't want you to support her."
0,This has been a great 4 month old mouse (mouse) working properly. The scroll wheel just came out. We'll see how the guarantee works.
0,"I had a lot of trouble getting this book, and I was so disappointed that the characters were portrayed in such an unbelievable, almost ridiculous way."
0,"Unfortunately, Norton Anti-Virus has finally become a bad product just like the rest of the Symantec line. For me, that was the only antivirus to use. After my computer slowed down. I don't know what Symantec is thinking, but maintaining customer loyalty is apparently not their priority."
0,"I was not a fan of this book as it was not a developmental book. Never provides practice exercises that help you improve your capabilities. If you want to read fictional novels, this book is for you, but if you want to learn to use your clairvoyant abilities skip this novel."
0,"I didn't like it, it didn't fit my door and it wasn't easy to assemble. Prepared it. I do not recommend this product."
0,"I had nothing but grief with this type of CD, and I'm not alone. After hitting my head against the wall for hours trying to troubleshoot it ... it's cheap, and I really mean it's cheap. And you get what you pay for. Avoid that."
0,"Why are there no replacement blades ????: A handy little saw to carry in the toolbox. . But why can't we buy replacement blades? I now have two beautiful handles, which are about to get into the trash. I will not buy another."
0,"Amazing references and awesome indexes, the sheer number of references in this book is confusing but the index is awesome !! The worst index I've ever seen in a textbook."
0,Poorly written waste of time: I'm a professional writer . I wasted my time and hard-earned cash on the hard-cover edition.
0,waste of time: This was a complete waste of time and money. If I could rate it lower than 1 star I would.
0,"Not a good product, and not what I was expecting at all. very bad. A waste of money. It should be inspected in the store before purchasing it."
0,"The product is too old for today's prices and that might be my fault for not researching enough. But even so, how do you sell a 5-year-old thing at current prices?"
0,"The saw is ok, designed for easy blade replacement after it wears out, but you can't get a replacement blade anywhere !! If you only want a disposable tool, then it is okay to own this saw. If you want to keep it, don't buy it. I have one that has blade replacements available, too bad, because I love the saw, but I won't buy another one. The handle can be recycled better than throw it away."
0,The saw works great but replacement blades are not available. It's a shame to throw the knob away when it's easy to regenerate with a blade.
0,"Great feature poor reliability: I bought two of these phones. They have all the features I want (speakerphone, mute button, hold button, caller ID) but I have to give it two stars because the first phone died after a few months and the second after about two years."""
0,"Yes, I have to echo the other reviewers and say it doesn't matter if the saw is good or not. Without easy access to replacement blades this is a waste of money. In my case, the saw blade at the handle broke off on second use and I can't find a replacement blade."
0,"This book is a great example of despicable design. Authors and designers want you to think you are getting something that you can't get in other books. It provides some great examples of notable people in Flash. But in the end, it's like a huge box that you open and open to get only straw."
0,This mug keeps warm for a long time. It is easy to drink from it and the liquid does not leak out when you tilt it. It will leak if turned over. Worth the money.
0,"This product was not very good. For several reasons: One of them is that the construction was bad, it broke into two pieces. The second was that it did not contain a file (scraper), which is what the ad said."
0,Pillow smaller than I expected and it's almost stuffed. I prepared it because the last stitches to close the hole where the filling was inserted was very crooked. Quality control needs improvement.
0,What a great way to balance and relax. This has really helped relieve some of the chronic back pain and is a great way to relieve stress.
0,"Works well, poor packing, looking like a used good. Mouse only came with a plastic bag, no warranty information, no instructions. Looks like I bought this from a used items seller from, which bothered me because they said it's brand new."
0,"It was my first attempt to buy shoes here, and it could even be the last. The shoe design is awesome! Wearing shoes for a day really hurts, and my ankle is swollen now! Really disappointing! """
0,I am not a fan of this company's products. Not sure why a product was so simple and poorly designed and manufactured. It should be light yellow and strong in appearance in the image.
0,Everything went well for the first two weeks. Then the lamp in the middle of the farm burned out at 10 pm. I had to use the light on my cell phone to get home safely. Very disappointing.
0,"I'm tired of buying rechargeable flashlights that last for 6 months. I read the reviews and thought this could be better. It was not. Six months later, the bulb went off, so far another waste flashlight."
0,"Absolutely shocking, in a word. The only good thing is that the shop gave me the full refund. Don't waste your time on it."
0,"I hate this program, it is not usable like previous versions. I still cannot create a simple ceiling in my design with this product. I don't do any landscaping. I will not buy this program."
0,"Horrible conditioner - noisy, looks good for first few hours of operation then starts condensation !!! The unit is filled with water after a few hours in the area where it is like a noisy paddle boat in the room. Spend the extra few dollars to get a better conditioner."
0,"I bought this conditioner to keep my bedroom cool at night and while I was working. It works great for the first hour or two of turning it on - but after a while, it starts blowing hot air up to sweating the last night. I won't trust this brand's conditioners again."
0,"When I received this, not only was it too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the stench that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, like the smell of burning rubber. There is no way I would recommend this to anyone."
0,"I ordered according to the size chart, it turned out the shoes are tiny !! Very uncomfortable, I have returned it"
0,"Although the topic was interesting, the lack of pictures and a general layout of the book made reading boring. I saw many opportunities for this book to be better. For example, there were many instances where an accompanying photo could clarify a description or put it in better context. The writing style seemed to me dry, almost a ""textbook""."
0,"This product is simply useless and does not work. Don't waste your money. Relative humidity appears 60% when actual relative humidity is 18%. Shows 80's when the actual temperature is 72, I'm amazed that this store still sells these things."
0,"Don't waste your time, this is the most boring book you have ever read. It started slow. By the time I finished, I didn't even care how it ended."
0,This mixer started great ... then it started leaking from its base. Inferior and weak design. . I do not recommend it.
0,"Too frustrating. It's very difficult to make juice. When I put frozen fruit in it, it gets clogged instantly. This happens even if you thaw the fruit first. And then, if you add milk powder, it will only get worse."
0,"It seems very convenient for the blender blades to be permanently attached to the bottom of the mixer cup. However, after only 2 months, it started to leak slightly from the bottom. After about two weeks, it began to leak so much that it was practically useless. It is an expensive junk heap. Save your money and buy a better brand."
0,"Horrible game !: Hey, I think this game is horrible because I hate it so much but my girlfriend loves it so much, and I think it's a rotten thing, it's a piece of trash."
0,"Disappointment at its best: After reading the back of the DVD case, I was looking forward to seeing this, but let me tell you this wasn’t good at all. The story is a bit difficult to follow and it didn’t interest me at all. The action sequences weren’t good at all. In my opinion, it is one of the worst cartoons I have ever seen."
0,"Absolute garbage, no description of this book whatsoever, no credibility at all, dialogue that makes the book comic and a complete lack of internal logic. Incredibly poor. I have rated this book as the worst-worst book I have read in many years."
0,"Too negative for my tastes: Although the author's immense talent shines through these simplistic books, I found the topic extremely disappointing."
0,"Very disappointing: I was expecting more realism in this movie, it was not at all what was announced. A better job could have been done."
1,"Study Smarter, not harder: love this book, and highly recommend it for anyone...received my order super-fast on regular delivery."""
1,"This bag is characterized by being soft to the touch, and all leather withstand bumps and scratches from daily use. The case will remain open on your desk and is flexible enough to be folded back onto itself."

1,"I bought a DVD. And I watched mostly DVD really well, with rich colors and crystal clear visuals. Although most of the footage is subtitled in English, I had no problem enjoying what I saw from the five films. Nice packaging, too."
1,"I bought this as a jogging cart for my four year old. Very sturdy structure, but support is not really strong for older kids. But it goes well and draws easily. Worth the price."
1,"I bought these pajamas for my boyfriend. At first I thought it might not be appropriate, but to our surprise, it does very well! Enough space for him to move comfortably. He said that it was the warmest thing he had on a cold winter night !! Great product !!"
1,We bought this heater hoping to warm our bedroom and save money. It heats up really well if left for a while. The only problem i am facing is that the heater is cracked from normal use and i am not sure if it is safe to use or not. Cracking appears to be a common problem with these heaters.
1,Good addition: Easy to install and provides an inexpensive way to be aware of someone at the door from a far corner of the house or even the back yard.
1,"A great addition to your existing doorbell system. It is not difficult to install, it is easy to place where it yields the best results."
1,"An album whenever I listen to it, I listen to music quality is very cool. I loved it, regardless of other people's complaints that I heard it wasn't new. I found it really fun and great music to fall asleep on. I would definitely recommend it to others. Amazing album."
1,"I own a number of products and I am very satisfied with their quality. The material quality is great for the price. It is very comfortable to use. The only complaint is that after a few months of use, rust is present on the sharp edges, but I think this is to be expected and can be taken care of easily."
1,I own about 200 exercise videos and consider myself advanced these exercises are great. I will order it again. It is different from other exercises that I have purchased.
1,"I enjoy this album a lot. Contains memorable topics. You start with some classic guitar playing, which gives you a great fun atmosphere."
1,"This book is one of my favorite math books; Simple and concise but contains a bit of an intellectual challenge. I agree with some comments that state that some examples skip some steps, but most are self-explanatory."
1,"It's a very interesting program, but the company does not support the product in any way, there is no technical support, there are no product updates, I need to keep working."
1,"It's a comfortable (mouse) mouse, that fits well in the palm of my hand. The buttons on the side are comfortable and responsive. The scroll is so cute, it feels like an expensive piece of hardware. But it doesn't work well. It stops working most of the time. I was very disappointed with the mouse."
1,"I recommend this book, it brings lots of laughter and fun for the whole family"
1,"Pampers, what a life saver. I ordered this for my granddaughter and it saved me time and money. I will buy again"
1,"Really lightning fast, this racetrack is amazing. I got it for my three-year-old son soon, he loves it very much. Cars really spin around the track. I will highly recommend it for car lovers. I thought it looked cheap in store, but it holds up well and the play value is definitely high."
1,"After a lot of research and testing of the strollers, this is the best canopy stroller, especially for the price. That's all you need"
1,"After 2 months of using this DVD set my body is back to normal. I love these exercises and I can't say enough cool things about them - they're fun and challenging, but you get results."
1,"These speakers are an excellent value for the price. I was really surprised by the quality of the physical aspects of the speaker, as well as the sound, which is quite warm and true to live performances. The oak is gorgeous.I had never heard of this company before, but I will be a lifelong purchaser of its products."""
1,"Great strength training. I've really noticed a difference in stamina and strength since I started doing this exercise. At first, I couldn't do many of the movements without adjusting them. After that, I immediately started getting better, and I could see and feel a real difference in my body. I highly recommend this exercise, especially to those who want to get in shape."
1,"A great home computer and I have to say it's a great desktop. It contains everything a computer user wants, it's fast, plenty of hard disk space, very high RAM, CD / DVD burner, etc. The overall desktop performance is great. I really recommend it."
1,"I really wasn't a fan of the textbook before, but it did the job. It contains lots of useful knowledge and advice on how to improve your daily life. I took a class last summer where we learned how to use alternative healing techniques, massages, and different exercises to heal our bodies and minds as a helpful book. All we need to know is listed. I give it 5/5"
1,"Really love this set of pots and pans. It meets my needs well, is easy to clean. These pots are really good for a small kitchen because the pots are on the smaller side. I would recommend this set as a great buy. We are planning to purchase more of these pans in a larger size as well."
1,"The entire series is engaging and fun for children and parents alike. A great way to introduce your child to books, nature and language. """
1,"Easy to install, works like magic, I had some trouble installing at first as I didn't follow the instructions. After following the directions, you should have no problem. Great product. He just needed to hear the doorbell in the family room with the TV on."
1,"This book is the best buy ever. It goes through every aspect of the test and has a very comprehensive review of all the exam-tested grammar (although I thought they had a little more than needed). Practice tests accurately measure the difficulty and format of the actual test. After it was a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher, I bought this book and used it for self-study. It helped me a lot."
1,"A gentle soap that is extra large, lathering well, and long-lasting. The only thing I don't like is the smell, because it's so strong. Next time I'll buy the unscented version."

1,"Lovely lovely stroller. It is easy to fold and open. It's durable, has a nice-sized basket underneath, and the handles are the perfect height. I wish it was a little wider and longer!"
1,"Great baby stroller, this is the cheapest double stroller on the market. If you want all the bells and whistles, be prepared to pay the extra money and have something else. If you want something that is easy to put in and take out of the car and easy to fold, this is ideal. Wonderful buy !! """
1,"Adorable little stroller, the most stroller I have used, light, easy and great on almost any terrain. The only problem with the stroller is that it does not provide much protection from the sun, but as I said, this adorable little stroller is well worth it."
1,"a great little phone case !!! It's pretty much what I was expecting except that some of the black is starting to fade in parts so that it has white spots in some areas. However, given what I paid for, I don't feel very upset."
1,"Beautiful mouse. Works great, hassle and no hassle - Plug and Play on any Windows system. Battery life is good and comfortable."
1,"The exercise video, it goes beyond exercise in a very descriptive way - which is very important for good form and injury reduction. It will make you sweat. It's great to have a home alternative to the gym."
1,great cheap hat: Just back from a 12 mile deer scouting hike and this hat was awesome. Kept the sun off my face and neck as planned. Might want to order at least 1 size larger than normal as they do run a bit small. Hard to beat for the price though...
1,"Reading this book is a lot of fun, and I definitely learned some new facts. This book stimulated my passion for thinking about the meanings of subtle and complex concepts. Book formatting helps arrange ideas in one's brain. Really interesting book and the cases were well chosen, although I personally don't like relying too much on extrapolation, but I also know this is inevitable sometimes."
1,"Good read: Very good read ,but hard to understand some parts.The slang used was hard to understand."

1,I had a hard-to-steer stroller and started looking for a new compact stroller that folded extremely small and had a carry handle. We loved it for the airport. The basket also contains a lot of things. I bought a separate cup holder ... it's a great stroller!
1,"A book that I enjoyed very much. Even though I was only seven years old, I had a great time reading it in my second grade. But I didn't like the last part. I recommend this series of books to children of all ages."
1,"Encyclopedia of Server & Network A to Z eBook is impressive (includes tons of graphs and lots of info). The only reason I give this book four stars is because I wish it had included a sample interactive test on CD. Sample tests are usually very helpful, and taking them on a computer determines the feel of the actual exam. Otherwise, it's an excellent book."
1,"An amazing easy-to-read book where the protagonist meets 3 great friends. They go on great adventures together. There is a lot of fun in every chapter. Once you start reading this book, you won't want to put it aside. I would recommend this book to all ages."
1,An excellent book for those who love to read tales about animals that use their intelligence to help people and sometimes get in trouble to do it the wrong way.
1,"Awesome book I bought for my 9-year-old son as a birthday gift. Although he is an excellent reader, it is sometimes difficult to get him to sit down and read. When he first opened the gift, he seemed really frustrated that it was a book and not a video game, but once he started reading it took little time to finish it alone. Not only that, I was asked to have another book in the series."
1,"An enchanting book, I preview all the books I dedicate for my children to read. I enjoyed this. Vivid descriptions allow me to clearly imagine the scene, a book that I will read to my 11- and 13-year-olds."
1,This book is essential for any software test kit. It gives you detailed step-by-step instructions on every aspect of the system testing process. Provide very helpful examples. I think you will benefit a lot from this book.

1,A super fun book with lovable characters and an above-average story. People who love animals would like to read this book.

1,"I totally enjoyed this movie. For those who love educational movies, this gives a very interesting new perspective to the genre. Well done!"
1,"I bought this story a few years ago and fell in love with it. The title pretty much spells out what's going on in it. The author does a great job. It is a pleasant reminder of the beautiful music of nature, especially in the places we live in when the sound of crickets is deafening in summer."
1,I liked this great documentary. It's not just photographically superior - not only does it have beautiful and inspiring music - it's realistic.
1,"I waited 3 weeks to receive my copy of ""Fluency in Flash Programming"" and I must say it is excellent and awesome. Clearly written content, step-by-step tutorials show you techniques you would not have thought of on your own. A copy is worth the money. All I can say is that if you are addicted to flash, buy it now!"
1,"I wasted a lot of dollars on a semi-personal training that didn't work. I asked for this and fired my coach that same week. Then within a month of using the workouts on the DVD, I saw changes that 9 months of training in the gym couldn't see."
1,I ordered this book when I first started decorating food dishes. It was a great tool to help me with techniques and even appetizer and ice cream recipes.
1,"We just installed the extended chime and it sounds 10 times better than a front doorbell. An excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to hear their backyard doorbell. Easy to install. Great sound, great price."
1,"It was a little slow at first, but it featured a more realistic depiction of human behavior in disaster. Other best exciting movies."
0,I was not impressed. Better tutorials and designs are available online for the curious browser. I felt the CD had some complexity to use and offered very little help. Keep this book on your coffee table ... its really not worth the high price.
1,"Wonderful mouse, better than I expected. I am very pleased with this thing. I did a lot of research and this met my needs, but more than that."
1,"The wireless laser mouse is cool and super fast. The scroll wheel is crazy, and it can be set to different speeds. The design gives your hand a firm grip and maximum comfort. I have replaced the standard batteries that came with the mouse to ensure maximum performance and longer life. This mouse has it all, it has a neat look and great functionality."
1,"Great mouse, very comfortable, very fit in your hand, lifetime responds great, this is the second I got as a gift Great product, high quality, I highly recommend it!"
1,"Excellent mouse, fits perfectly in my hand and is great for long term use. I use it for detailed tasks like rendering in 3D. It's also an excellent gaming mouse. Battery life appears to be pretty good, and there is no slowing down of responses. What an excellent mouse for the money and it does whatever it should."
1,"A mouse with many buttons and very versatile, you can control the volume, mute, open e-mail, etc. A very cool mouse."
1,"Nice collection - it gives you the basics for keeping simple swimming pools clean, but they are so flimsy and poorly made. The net broke the first time we used it, only to get some papers out of the pool. And we hope we can get a better made replacement from this manufacturer."
1,a great set for any aquarium keeper. Every test you will need at any time to ensure the quality of your aquarium water. Easy instructions. With this set you will always know your water quality. Very good price and fast shipping as well

1,Super: This purchase was easy and delivered very quickly. I would do business with this individual again.
1,"Great product, it took me less than five minutes to set up and works like a charm. The original bell is located in the kitchen located at the back of the house. I put this in front of the house and no problems whatsoever! I highly recommend this product."
1,"Great product, the soap is very soft and gentle and does not leave any residue like some drugstore ""lotions"" soaps. Rinses thoroughly and leaves skin feeling soft. I like that ."

1,"Great product, it came faster than expected, I love this mouse, its great service encourages you to buy something like it next times"
1,Excellent product for cutting and cleaning grapes in the field. Also good for chasing smelly bugs from groups. Pressing it throughout the day won't burn your hand muscles. Stay sharp for a long time. All in all an excellent tool. Don't even think about harvesting with your pruning shears anymore. Just get a pair of this product.
1,Nice music I enjoy. This is what I was looking for and I'm glad I got a copy. Thank you.
1,Nice music I enjoy. This is what I was looking for and I'm glad I got a copy. Thank you.
1,"Great music, great beat, really good album, nice ambiance."
1,Good author and book suitable for younger readers. It takes traditional stories from different countries and creates new stories that last like the originals.
1,An author who writes beautifully and her story is very inspiring. She is an autistic woman who has overcome severe habits. She has a knack for helping the reader understand what autism is like for her. She explains in detail how she overcame the tremendous difficulties of autism and created a very beautiful and meaningful life. I love writing it and I highly recommend its books if you want to understand the true meaning of overcoming obstacles and moving forward towards living a full life.
1,"Great features and quality of this baby stroller, very strong cool, love it! Includes a great parent tray that holds two cups and two small areas for other things (keys, phones, etc.). It also features a wet wipe dispenser with a storage compartment underneath. This cart is very easy to push and steer, but is rather heavy and bulky when folded.

1,"This book is very simple and fast to read. The concept is interesting. The author had a beautiful literary style. This book lacked depth and emotional appeal.

1,"This book is awesome, I used this book in my entomology class, and I think it's great! I would like to be an entomologist and already know a lot of information on this topic, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it quite easily too.

0,After years of satisfactory use this faucet is ready for junk . We have tried unsuccessfully to talk with warranty personnel concerning a problem that no plumber can solve.. We are saddened and very disappointed in their lack of interest and response. The faucet was very expensive and is now ready for burial in the landfill!

0,"Bad quality, the handle is weak and keeps breaking. They are simply poorly made vacuum cleaner . Spend more money and get something that works."
0,Okay but Not Great: The product arrived early which was nice. The product takes much longer to dehydrate fruit than the instructions indicate. Another thing about the machine there is NO on/off switch. just unplug it .
0,"I had this coffee maker for 2 1/2 years before it just gave up and stopped making coffee last week. I would gladly pay this type of premium for better coffee but this machine is not worth it. First and most importantly, the coffee is never hot. . I was glad when it died."

0,"It worked fine but it broke down after 3 months, we were happy with it. It picks up food from the carpet well, is quiet and convenient to use. However, the fact that it broke after 3 months doesn't make it worth it. We are now considering a quiet vacuum or a quality carpet vacuum cleaner instead."
0,When I first got the unit it worked fine. I noticed after the about three uses it's motor was slowing down. I replaced the battery but it did not help. I would not purchase another this trade mark  unit being afraid it would all so die a quick death. Spend more money on a unit that will last longer.

0,"We had such high hopes for this colander. It was beautiful. Within months it started to rust around the rim. Shortly thereafter it started rusting around the drain holes rendering it totally useless. A colander should last years, not months."
0,This noisy machine was extemely disappointing . You have to put in a lot of ice cream in the machine to achieve a single serving because a large portion of the ice cream remained in the twisting portion of the unit. Certainly not worth the rather high price.

With them we were able to attend a 2 hour walking garden tour.

1,"I'm a big guy and this stool holds my weight and is comfortable. I purchased this stool for a 20 mile  trip, it is lightweight and compact."""
1,"Tripod and seat size, makes this travel chair excruciatingly uncomfortable for anyone weighing more than 120 lbs. On the other hand, since the chair looks rather sturdy, it should be completely acceptable to women and young children. ”"

0,"good size, difficult to assemble: The size of this toy box is great! It holds plenty. I like that there are no small screws and bolts and it will not squeeze small fingers. To be honest it was a pain to assemble. Trying to put plastic pieces into slots and then to line them up took two of us."""
0,"Sad. Terrible.: I was required to read this book for school, and found it throughly depressing. Its a series of short stories about teen immigrants, most of which end in sadness. Don't buy unless you like depressing stories."""
0,Big Mistake: Did a big mistake buying this item. It would have been better if i had ordered my previous trimmer from another brand.
0,Big disappointment: This trimmer stops charging after a few months. It won't work .. a useless piece of junk.
0,"I imagine this is a very creative, strange book. Too dark to me, too brutal, and too mean. I wanted to keep going, but there was no point in forcing myself to submit to things that made me so uncomfortable."
0,"The parts are defective and are not as shown on the package. . What appears on the package is not what is in the package, so the final product is not what is advertised at all."
0,"Love the look of these kettles, but it looks like they all rust for the first year. . It is more sensitive to water. This is really unfortunate when you talk about a tea kettle. Avoid it as it is a waste of money."
0,"If you are seriously interested in finding a cure for your chronic constipation, do not buy this product.

0,I can describe this book in one word stupid. Don't waste your time or money it simply isn't worth it. In fact I am not even sure why it was published.
0,"The worst product I have ever owned. As many other people have reported, the camera started eating the tapes after only a few hours of use on it. I lost a lot of precious moments recorded on tape due to tape loading issue, the only good thing I can say about this camera is that the bag was big."
0,"Worst product ever, terrible product that shouldn't be bought. The blades were not very sharp and the device was not well trimmed. After a few months, the battery refuses to charge and maintains charge. Unfortunately, the device only works from batteries. When the battery is dead, the trimmer will not function even when plugged in. Don't waste your money on such a device."
0,"I bought this razor a year ago and it worked perfectly until the plastic comb guiding the razor broke. A product works and broken plastic, what is the solution?"
1,"I bought this product because my boyfriend seriously needs to trim his beard. In terms of price, it is inexpensive. It looks solid and strong. It is rechargeable. He got his gift yesterday and he loves it because it is so simple, very easy to use, portable and it meets his needs for a perfect trimming of his facial hair."
0,I think it was written poorly. The story was long and boring. I thought I'd try to find another book. I will never buy this again.
0,"Shaver looks good. However, it does not hold the battery charging for more than two parts. The charger cannot be used to operate the trimmer. Therefore, you should wait 14-16 hours to use it if it is not fully charged. This is the worst trimmer I have ever used. Bad design. """
0,Great razor when fully charged but you have no idea when it will die on you. There is no indication of the amount of electrical charge in it.
0,"The product worked fine for the first 2 days. I was very pleased with it. However, after 2 weeks I started to have some issues with the battery. Somehow, the trimmer kept switching off when I put it at a certain angle to my face. I have recharged the battery many times but it still hasn't been fixed. . Too bad experience with it."
0,"I disagree . After reading more than 50% of the book, I had to stop ... I could neither interact with it nor enjoy reading it. I didn't like the writing style."

0,"I am a beginner in network programming. A friend suggested this book as the first hypothetical book to start with. I'm totally frustrated. It is not a practical, quick, or internet age book. The CD is completely useless. It contains quite a few files that you can download for free anyway."

0,I started transferring video from my camera to my computer only to discover that this stupid camera eats the tapes. I've lost two tapes so far. The problem of eating the tapes  is a big problem with this unit. They knew about it and kept ignoring it. I will never buy a product from this company. They are stupid for doing this to their clients.
0,Very simple - it doesn't deserve even one star. A complete waste of time. Save your money! Do not buy this trash !!!
0,"Battery worked great for at least a year. Now the battery will not hold a charge so it is worthless. . Very frustrating. """

0,"After about a year of use, the camera started eating the tapes. Do a google search on this subject, there are hundreds of people struggling with the same issue."
0,The screen shattered the first day I got this bag. It does not provide any protection for the LCD screen whatsoever. I totally recommend not purchasing this product.
0,The author's intense focus on the inner thoughts and feelings of the main character limits the reader's range and prevents a broad view of the social environment.
0,"Terrible design, hard to use, rust easily. It's hard to believe that a tea kettle was made with such a terrible, poor design."
0,The repetition of information and the slow pace gave this book a feel for elementary school reading material. This series could have been shortened into one book and it would have been better. I gave him 2 stars for rare plot twists that made me look at the book instead of throwing  it.

0,Used this trimmer probably less than a dozen times - for just a few minutes each time . motor died. What a waste of money.
0,The image is deceptive: Do not purchase this product if you think you are getting a photo-like pillow. It has a completely different look than the one in the picture. Charcoal gray ??? Ha !!!! Like a silver !!!!!!
0,"The picture is great but the quality is poor. For something that states it is art print, I found it nothing more than poster paper."
0,"Usually, I force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun,"" because I think I should), but when I read this book for the English language, I quickly realize it is one of the worst books ever. Classic details, boring It never ends and nobody cares about it. I feel boring."
0,"When I received the shaver, connected it to electricity to charge it, I used it several times until the battery ran out, the problem is no matter how long I tried to charge it, her mom will only work for a few seconds and then stop, and it is clear that the battery is very cheap and very bad and it is a useless shaver."
0,"When I opened this trimmer, I found that the inside plastic bag was torn and there was beard hair cut into the blades. Naturally, I prepared it, it's annoying if you order a new product, then a used product is sent. It's disgusting."
0,Not recommended: I have to agree with most of the reviews here. This saw is a peice of junk. I returned it almost immediatey. What a waste of time! I should have read the reviews here first!
0,Really boring: Have you ever heard someone speak in a monotone voice? Everything is tweaked to a certain point that begins to lull you into sleep. This is what this cd does for me.
0,"At first this printer was working fine, but after a year it was only an issue to start with. You cannot print more than 4-5 pages before the Page Grabber starts capturing more than one sheet at a time, and the text ends up passing through both of them."

0,"A quick but mostly unpleasant read: This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seeks any joy in her life. The overall feel of the story is negative and dreary. """
0,I read the book and it was very boring. Glad that I didn't pay much for it. I give it a star.
0,"Good story- Poor writing: Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author ."
0,"Good story, but not great. It wasn't my favorite. In fact, I was completely unhappy with it. Now don't get me wrong, it's a great story but it bothers me. My goal is to read and benefit, not boredom."
0,Decent story makes you turn pages. The problem is not enough pages. The story ends to leave you in the middle of the sequence. I don't like paying $ 8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next book in a series. Each book in the series should be stand-alone.
0,"Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality: This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily , and its not built well enough ."
0,"Rubbish: What a piece of trash. The top was chopped and lumpy and trying to clean it was a nightmare. Too frustrating. Shipping was fast, but too expensive. """

0,The condition of the book was very poor. It totally fell apart when I turned every page. The book is very old and not in good condition.
0,This was a great beard trimmer while it worked. But the charger completely stopped working so it malfunctioned. I don't understand how companies that manufacture products to do such a particular thing are unable to succeed. How can battery companies not make batteries that work? It's unbelievable to me.
0,"A book that really disappointed me. Sounds like a story. No real plot just a recurring narrative. Hope I could say I loved it ... but was really, really disappointed."
0,"Bad book. A book that doesn't make you want to go to the next chapter. I kept trying to figure out if this would get me to the end, but after 10 or so chapters of being laden with prose, I gave up. Thank God it was a library book. """
0,Not a bad book but I was expecting more. I never found myself locked in waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to let it go. One thing I didn't like is that the classes are small. I wouldn't buy the next book in the series.
0,"The book is boring if you try to read it without taking a hard look at the movie first, but it is easy to understand once you fail in class on every test your teacher gives you! It was boring and I fell asleep every time I went to read it."
0,"A very boring book, truly a totally implausible bad book with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe that this book is very popular abroad. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for him that no one liked his boring book."
0,"A hard-to-read book, and it doesn't seem like it will add to my culture. I am struggling to finish it and I might give up. """
0,"I was hoping to have some entertainment while reading things that would keep my interest but like most magazines, this magazine was filled with ads and articles either generic or just not catching my eye. Not interesting article."

0,"Do not buy this brand, I was originally happy to make the washer but the connector between the washer and the hose broke, when I ordered the parts it took more than a year to get the parts. It is in ignorance that it took so long to replace a plastic part that should have been mass-produced with so much spare. Don't buy, the customer service is appalling and the machine breaks down easily, not to mention it takes a year to repair."
0,Don't waste your money: I bought this game at a low price and it still feels like I've been hacked. The controls are an absolute nightmare and make what would otherwise be a decent game terrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever.
0,does not work. This is a bad product. The device needs to be recalibrated at every stage and even then it refuses to give an accurate reading. I will return it ..
0,You cannot connect it and use it directly. You have to let it charge for an hour. Very frustrating and disappointing.

0,"I bought this product a few months and I have used it around twice a month. Well, now the battery is dead and since this trimmer doesn't allow to use it while you have it connected to the electricity, it is just useless, a piece of junk!"""
0,"I bought this hoping to reduce some of the little bumps on my cheek and even out my skin tone. The next morning after using it, I woke up with pimples on my face! After three weeks of using it every day, my face became covered with sores that never healed! I don't want to say it's a bad product, because it clearly works for most of the people who have written reviews, but my experience wasn't that good. This is life."
0,"I just got a camera and really liked its size and low weight. But once I tried it, the fun quickly ended. Recording in low light was horrible and even with low light mode selected, that was unacceptable. And in night mode, everything moves in slow motion. Overall, the quality was not that great."
0,The rechargeable battery has died in just over a year. I need to plug it in overnight so I can use it again the next few times. What a waste I am back again shopping for a shaver.

0,"I had no choice but to throw this author's CD in the trash. I wouldn't torment anyone by giving them this CD as a gift! Not possible! I  threw it away! """
0,"Really cool razor in action and then broke. She did not reach the third month. I only use it once every two weeks. It has not been abused. It is rubbish. They will send me a new unit within 7--10 working days. Regardless, not being able to use the trimmer for more than two weeks is very annoying."
0,Laptop adapter stopped working after 4 months and tech support is horrible. The support team was very unhelpful and they told me it would take weeks to replace it. Other transformer alternatives don't look much better.
0,"The laptop adapter does not work, the charger switches between charging and not charging. Occasionally, if left on, it will charge continuously. I thought to keep it, but it is unreliable."
0,"Very upset with this product because: it makes a high-pitched sound, it intermittently stops providing enough power causing my computer to constantly switch back and forth between battery power and the wall. I will try to return it during the warranty process."

0,Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
0,"Great product and short battery life. I have enjoyed using this shaver, but the battery does not last long. It's not the end of the world considering you can plug it in to electricity and shave."
0,"Horrible product, I hope to give it negative stars. If you want to waste your money on a product that damages your skin, this is the product for you. If you want to do business with a company that doesn't care about anything except making a quick buck, buy from that company."

0,"Since I bought this and charged my laptop, the laptop has not worked. Do not buy it."
0,"Waste Money !: Just like others' bad review, it's because of the battery. I hardly used it and when I tried to charge it a few months after leaving it there the battery hadn't charged."
0,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The worst piece of filth I have read in my entire life. If you were a high school student, like me, you know the hell I have to go through and I think you don't want to put yourself in it."
0,This product is not what I expected at all .... it is a little bigger and the quality is not that great. Dislike . It flexes and bends which means that it is easily breakable. I'll return it !!
0,"This product is nearly half of Apple's offered price. It doesn't have a charging light, but for me it's worth the price. The product charges the battery so that's all I'm looking for."

I have never tried putting them in the dishwasher because they are so easy to clean by hand but it certainly is nice to know they are tough enough for that. You won't regret buying these and they really do last forever!
1,These bibs are great. The adjustable neck is soft and comfortable for my baby. They are insanely easy to clean. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is they are too thin. They would be perfect if they were just a little thicker.

How sad it is that this adorable talented heroine is being manipulated by nearly everyone she meets as well as by a terrible secret that consumes her all. She bears whatever comes her way, and most of all, she is a survivor. """

0,"I know this toolkit looks pretty cheap but I didn't expect it that bad. It's just so bad. First, don't get fooled by 160 when there are only about 50 actual tool parts in the set. It is clear that all tools are very poorly made. It  would be better off spending the money on another nice set of tools."
0,"This is by far the cheapest fireplace kit we have ever owned. It's flimsy and a 3-year-old can easily carry it - I mean it's lightweight. Winter is almost over and as soon as we do our last use, it's in the trash. Something very frustrating."
0,"I only owned the product for 3 months; The handle bent and then broke. As a teacher, I use this puncher completely daily. 30 sheets at a time. If you need large capacity and high quality, look elsewhere. """
0,"First of all, I didn't get all the parts on the first shipment. The printer never works. I contacted seller via email for 7 days and did not receive a response. I can't give this seller any stars because I bought a printer that isn't working and I'm getting no response from it. I will not buy anything from this seller and would suggest others to do the same."
0,Disappointed: the network was much larger than it appears on the site. It is very strong but its handle is very short. I need a longer handle. This size will not serve me anything.
0,"Disappointed.: I was really excited about these! But once receiving them, one of the lens wasn't completely set into the frames, and they were bent. Also, they are VERY dark, just fyi. The look is fantastic, but the quality was poor. But I guess thats my fault for not spending more money."

0,"The glasses look good, but the frame was bent and the lens fell off on the first day. The glasses are wide to fit my face. I do not like it."
0,"Poorly Designed, Low Quality: Very disappointed. Battery dies quickly. The product design is so poor that it's difficult to hold it while cleaning teeth and your fingers start to feel numb within minutes. The worst part - the product stopped working within 6 months. Don't waste your money."

0,"I had this camera for less than a month and something in the lens broke. I loved the quality of the pics and the camera in general.

0,One of the worst books I've read. I couldn't continue reading it. It was totally unrealistic; the contrasts were stark. I found my attention wandering every time I read it.
0,The book contains flowery language but the content doesn't take you anywhere. The plot and language are repetitive and do not capture my attention. It seemed as if the writer had a point she was trying hard to get to but that never happened.

0,"This chair is less comfortable than a rock. I don't know how anyone can sit on it. I kept the seat because it folds down to a small size and is lightweight, so it's easy to move. Otherwise, I hate it."
0,"The description of the manufacturer is misleading. It has been described as a universal basic broom. But it does not work on hard wood floors. I wanted something to capture all the debris my children bring on our wooden floors, which cover the rest of our home. It is designed for carpets only. My problem is that the product is not as versatile as the manufacturer claims."

0,"After using the charger for about two weeks, I started to notice a decrease in the power supply to the iBook. After about two months the charger stopped working completely. Upon inspection, I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the connection to break."
0,"Defective item: When I plug in the charger, it switches between charging and not charging every 2 seconds. There is clearly an epidemic of defective chargers."

0,"Owning and using this printer was a very frustrating experience. The prints appear dark in color. This printer should be left on at all times all the time because if you turn it off, it requires 3 full size glossy sheets of paper to be able to realign the printheads - waste of ink and paper! It was expensive, taking up so much space, that I wasn't really happy with it. I will give it zero stars if I can.."
0,"A few months after we bought the TV, we noticed dark gray spots on the screen. Fortunately, the TV was still under warranty as it was repaired right away. Then we recently got a blue spot in the bottom corner of the TV.

I can fill it with ice and the engine never stops. It has a very large capacity so that I can make an entire cup of juice for all of us in one go! Cleaning is fun, too.

Lightweight and made of plastic, I really didn't think I'd love it for so long. I was looking for something more substantial. I'm so happy I took the chance.

1,"Very pleased with the coat, the person you gave him was also happy and pleased."
1,"The walker is colorful, and attractive to parents because of the educational wooden blocks, but it is not practical at all for learning to walk. It is very heavy, so even though a child can push it, he cannot turn it, so it stops as soon as he hits a wall. New parent advice is to purchase a cheaper walker that is more practical for a toddler. The cubes are attractive, but you can always purchase them separately."

0,"I love the speed with which I can grind a lot of peppers using this grinder to prepare large dishes. However, the button often gets stuck in the ""on"" position, so this is not useful when you need to grind small amounts on an individual plate. I hated the mill despite my love for pepper. """

0,"Not as advertised: This product should have been sold with a new computer, not individually. It's for one time use only, so my review for this product is as low as possible. I will never buy from this seller again."
0,". Poor: In order to install XP Home Edition, I had to connect to the Internet first. Secondly, I thought I requested the professional version but I received the main version. Third, I had to pay $ 129.00 to the morbid squad to download the software to my new computer, and the software is clearly not designed for easy downloading; in the past I used to buy additional software and it was very easy to download it to my home computer. If I had known this, I would have gone straight and bought the full version of Best Buy Circuit City, for example, because I didn't save a penny"
0,Worst service ever: the customer didn't provide me with the product. After emailing the person there is no response.
0,"Has Fructose in it! Bad for yeast overgrowth!: I have to go to another website to read all information on this product: dosage, servings, active and inactive ingredients. If you have a yeast problem, fructose/sugar is not recommended, otherwise I would have ordered it. Also, a bit pricey!"
0,"doesn't work: This works for a few days holding down the carpets, but then it stops sticking and the carpet doesn't stay... we use this for the small rugs in our entrance, and at the bottom of the stairs..."
0,"Big Disappointment: I expected a wonderful resource of Christmas tunes and their history, what I got was a miserable book with very little information, some of it completely wrong. It excludes many of the tunes because of copyright--for the price, they could have gotten permission--it is very easy to do--simply call the owner or write them a letter--most of the time there is no charge."
0,"Quite poor thriller: This is one of the worst thrillers / mysteries I have read. The characters are unbelievable, the dialogue is exceedingly disappointing .. what else can I say?"
0,"Pure garbage: This book,simply put...pure garbage. The author may have gone to a Christian Science church but never understood Christian Science. Don't waste your time reading this book about C.S. Read Mary Baker Eddy's, 'Science and Health', and judge for yourself."
0,"Not worth your time: Although my first review was deleted, I repeat that this book sadly misrepresents CS. The author has used a sensationalistic, attention-grabbing method to try and make people think that CS is evil. It is true it has many problems, but the only thing this author has done has applied psycho babble to ""prove"" her point. If you buy this book, I urge you to read other sources on Christian Science, both positive and negative, to gain a better understanding of this controversial religion. Regardless of your opinion or lack of opinion on Christian Science, don't just take this author's word for it. She's just way too biased to be believed."
0,I never liked this because the handle sticks up so high you can't put a lid on the pot unless you use a massive pot. I only use it once in a while but after only a few uses the legs started falling off. The thing is useless and broken after just a few months. This was a huge waste of money.
0,"Piece of Junk: This is a very poorly made steamer. It's nice that the legs are high but they bend from the base very easily, I always needed to straighten them before putting it in the pot. Then they eventually fell off. Mine is now in the trash. (I owned it for about 4 months with moderate usage.)The tall handle is good if you only plan to use it in large pots. I would have to unscrew the handle in order to use it in smaller pots and then try to screw it back in while trying to avoid being burned by the steam so I could take it out of the pot. I've found this to be a very frustrating steamer and I don't recommend it."
0,Garbage!: Pieces of the steamer came off when I lifted it out of the shipping container. Soon after one of the legs fell off. It's constructed so that you can't repair it. Unbelievable!. I'm furious!
0,"Disappointing: I thought this would be a great concept and opportunity for Bob Greene to motivate through each week of progress. There is very little motivational commentary and advice. A few simple diet rules at the beginning (nothing comprehensive) and then the weekly exercise program. I expected him to include motivational comments and add on additional nutritionally / diet goals each week. But nothing except for the weekly exercise programs. On the plus side, the exercise programs are short and easy to fit into your schedule. They change each week adding more challenge and variety."
0,worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
0,"To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game."
0,Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - The control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable .save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something.the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: I could only read the beginning 8 chapters. No excitement.
0,"one woman short: This was an okay book. It was not too exciting. Really, I mean it was bad . I was disappointed because I had just finished reading 10 straight good books. But this book was something to read if u have nothing else to do."
0,"Good, but only to the midway point: This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
0,"a terrible product: this is not well manufactured I received it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed .I put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS."
0,it sucks: just don't give this to your kids it will make them lose brain cells and i didn't even know a movie could do such a thing
0,this is horrible: I would have rather thrown my money in a well than to watch this movie it was soo bad i cant believe i watched this movie
0,"So cute: My son loves it. My complaint is that it lasted about 8 months. I thought the battery died, but the whole engine did. Once dead, it's pretty useless because you can't push it on the tracks.Just bought a replacement."
0,Cold Coffee: I bought this coffee maker and I regret it. This machine is heavy and awkward and the coffee is cold. Buyer Beware
0,"Cheap and useless: I have this broom for less than a year. It can't handle anything larger than sand, it smells of burning rubber, and as for the design, the power button is in an inconvenient place. I should have brought her back right away."
0,No charger came with it: This item didn't ship with a charger.. Ended up having to spend an extra 40 for a new charger....Im sure the product works great but buying it from amazon was a waste...
0,"Defective product : Audio 1/4"" to 1/8"" Stereo Adapter does not work. It's a waste of $4. . I will not buy anything from this mall again."
0,"Incoherent, Misquoting, incomprehensible literature!: Many sentences are incomplete, and the author misquotes scripture. The majority of this book are quotes, assumptions, and fiction. He support the majority of minor issues and does not provide evidential support for his own opinions so the reader has no idea how he came up with them."
0,"I have two of  Roomba brooms. Our Rumba is used twice daily. Although it cleans well, I had a lot of problems keeping it working in the drive despite cleaning it, cleaning the brushes and spreading them with air after each use. The process people became boring. I can only conclude that the long-term tolerance is, at best, questionable and that the maintenance of this type of vacuum cleaner is much greater than that of regular vacuum cleaners."
0,I bought 4 roomba vacuum cleaners in 3 months. The first worked for 10 hours. And the last for two hours. I will get it back and get my money back.
0,"Don't buy this product !: I bought this cleaner a year ago for use in my office ... stuck to the carpet is a terrible product. I was going to return it to the manufacturer but I found out that they were working to resell the product, so I canceled the idea. I made many purchases over the years. This is the worst product I have ever purchased.. do not buy!"
0,"Quality as always: I always go with fiber optic cables, given their quality, I am not very proud of their name because they triple the price."
0,"The book I read is the worst ever. It is one of the most boring things since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I really wanted to kill myself. But I gave her another chance. And another. I was constantly disappointed. Do not waste your tired money on this book!"
0,"Get some new ideas: come up with some new movie ideas! If not, the movies will become abhorrent and hateful!"
0,"Bad purchase: We bought this inflatable mattress, but it shrank after inflatable. We tried again. The same end, we tried to find the leak with soap and water. Finally we asked for a new valve for the mattress to swell, shrinking again even with the new valve. We are not satisfied with this purchase."
0,Air leakage - unusable: You have inflated this mattress. A large amount of air leaked within one hour. Do not buy this.
0,"Battery-powered pump is not working: I see some bad reviews about this product, but I find it interesting that no one has complained about the fact that the battery-powered air pump is a complete garbage. . I admit that the mattress looks really pretty, and you may feel comfortable sleeping after it's completely inflated, but what's good about that if the pump isn't working? To make matters worse, I tried to put the damned thing inside the box to get it back, but the damned thing doesn't even get inside! While you're inside the box, there's no space to put the pump in, and the box looks like it's about to explode. This product is not worth getting it."
0,I paid for this product but never received it - beware !!!!: I placed my order in a month ago and am still waiting for it to arrive.
0,"don't waste your money: Do not waste your money buying this item. I tested it on various glass surfaces and it did not perform well, it didn't even puncture skin."
0,It does not work: How can it save life if it does not work? it is a gift. I am very disappointed about this product.
0,"Strange, bad writing and movie as a drinking game. Save your money and buy something else useful instead."
0,Bad plastic smell and taste: I had this kettle a few weeks ago and tried everything in its manual to get rid of the smell and taste of plastic. Nothing worked and I was not prepared to know whether or not the odor would disappear after two months of use. How many bad cups of tea does this company expect to drink?
0,"Not good: the cover broke from the first time I tried to use it, and because charging it again would be expensive. I will not buy this again."
0,"Save time and money - do a Google search to get information on the topic. This book has no value, all that the author mainly advertises on his websites."
0,Very weak product: This company should not manufacture or sell these products. When I use it I cannot focus at all. I had a headache by using it for less than a minute. I have three other perspectives and they all work much better than these. Very disappointing.
0,"Incredibly terrifying !: I feel I have to write a few comments to prevent others from wasting their money. This book appears to have been written by a seventh grader with poor grammar skills! As another reviewer notes, there is a typo on the cover, and I think there is at least one for each chapter. For example , . I was so distracted by poor writing and poor script, that I decided to read with a pencil in the hand to mark all the grammatical rules and terrible spelling. Please do not waste your money on such a book."
0,"Problem charging AAA size battery: I got this charger more than 2 years ago. Charging AA batteries is ok, but it has a huge problem charging AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries, you need to flip the little button on the positive electrode and follow a specific method for charging. It is a tiring process."
0,"Maybe I got a bad one: My experience: I got this from FM, not from Amazon. The DVD player sometimes beats loudly when I put a DVD. The picture quality was not very impressive, and a horizontal line in the middle of the screen did not disappear. Plus one of the other reviewers died because of the remote control - it makes no sense to plan at all! Very poor human engineering. I brought him to the store to get the money back."
0,Waste money: The suction process of this cordless vacuum cleaner is so weak that it does not pick up anything from the hardwood floor in our house! It is very very frustrating
0,"Not a solid oar: This oar has very limited durability. After buying oars, they were all broken down because their handles were rubber."
0,Not exciting: I never liked a book that was carelessly written. It is better to spend money somewhere else.
0,poor new design: I purchased this to replace our older one. We have the same mat but was stained from red sauce. This new mat has different suction cups that do not work. So it fails to stay put.
0,"There is not much to say: Purchasing this type of glove is always a good business. This is the third pair that I bought, and they were all good quality, etc. It is not a protective glove in the world (therefore, look for the impact-resistant type), but it is stiff, good, and definitely helps in dealing with heat problems."
0,"That's not what I expected ...: As a graphic artist, this book was a book about molds, and I personally created and did much better than what appeared here. This is the last book I bought for this author"
0,"Don't buy this game: this is a terrible game, I mean, it's totally stupid. Fish represent real pain when caught. Moreover, the game contains the worst music I have ever heard. Strange controls to get new levels you need to overcome challenges that are impossible. You have very little time to catch many really rare fish. Do not waste your time or money buying such a game"
0,"Disappointment: I am very disappointed with this program. It crashes and looks very slow. I expected something much better than a product that cost a lot. I need to create some written messages for my clients, so I don't know what to do. I would have no choice but to buy another product. I have to get my job done and I shouldn't be constantly frustrated by the way the program falters."
0,"horrible: This is one of the worst albums of priests, a good nightclub only for 12 year old kids"
0,"Sad, sad, sad: I was so excited to get this book and then realized it was just a real advertisement of books that customers use. If you browse this book, on each page you will see the website of the books of these authors. We are educated people and we cannot stop quoting the book we are reading. Unfortunately very unhelpful."
0,"Inherent battery  problem:After a month of use, this phone no longer has the ability to charge. I returned it and got a new one. Now the new device does not charge too. This could be a wrong model for design."
0,"Waste: it is simply a bad product. I bought it completely new, without scratches, but the disc acted like I had scratched it terribly. . We were never able to finish the game because it will return to the main menu after midway through any game. The disc may be damaged, and if not, then it can only be said that it is a bad product."
0,"Save your money: Sorry to say, its not worth the money. Some very old illustrations. I would be ashamed to charge this amount of money for such little substance."""
0,"I can't think of any use of this cart. She is flimsy, wobbly and ugly. The bottom is not well installed. Wheels are low, making them roll from side to side like a broken shopping cart. I threw it"
0,"Not at all accurate: This scale gives a different reading every time you step on it- even if you step on and off within a matter of seconds. It can fluctuate up to 5lbs within minutes. I use this scale on a flat hard floor. It is completely useless."""
0,"Not as good as before, I purchased a chair a few years ago, it was great. I ordered this one thinking it would be as good. But I was wrong. The seat was too high at its lowest position even for a tall guy . The seat cushion was too hard to sit even for a few minutes. So it would not be good to sit for a long time. I returned this item. But was charged $60.00 for shipping."""
0,"I didn't feel much fun with this dvd there are some very amazing music. Unfortunately, the footage is substandard which makes the viewing experience unsatisfactory. But the sound is great. DVD to listen, not to watch."

0,"The worst microwave oven ever !!! Don't buy it: This is the worst microwave oven I've ever used, and it didn't work well .. Customer service is worse. The man tried to convince me that the oven was designed to work as it was. . The worst of all is that I will have to pay $ 15 to replace this defective oven! In conclusion, do not buy this item unless you want to enjoy a very strange (and rare) oven and a terrible microwave.weird (and rare) oven and the horrible microwave."
0,"bad quality materials in these slippers: I was so happy to have some new warm slippers! Sadly, they didn't even last for two months of gentle use! The soles are falling off and I have rubber bits all over the house. The slippers are already in the trash can. Don't waste your money on these."""
0,"I hate to say this as a fan of this band, but their new album is just a big waste of money. Their first album was one of the best albums of all time, but this one is bad. Songs are poor. No real guitars, no letters to any of the chant, nothing. . I hate hate to say that but don't waste your money or time on this. It was a wonderful band."
0,"This book appears to be designed to sell specific hardware and software. Costly, waste of money, with no interest. I can't afford to waste the kind of money I paid for this book. The title is very misleading. A severe disappointed"
0,Please read eloquent comments by others for this poor quality book. It lacks clear and explicit explanation
0,This book is unhelpful and frustrating in many ways. The design of the book is uninspiring. Pink horizontal lines on each page do not improve the appearance of the book but instead distract attention. The only nice thing about this book is that the commonly used examples are of high quality design.
0,Bad printing: All left hand pages had extremely faded ink. Very difficult to make out the words. Lousy print job.
0,"Really disappointing, I made an order for the soles size 6 when the order arrived it was written on the box 6 but the actual size of the soles was 11. The box was filled with cat hair. I am allergic to cats, the slippers leave marks on the floor when using it. The slippers are also smelly. I brought it back."

0,I thought I liked the movie when I was a child but now when I watched it with my niece I realized it wasn't good. The new version Disney brought out in the early 2000s is great.
0,"This movie could have been awesome but it is far from it, and perhaps one of the worst movies this producing company has ever made. It is slow moving, not new events. Just a waste of time"
0,"My son is obsessed with Disney cartoons, so it was natural for him to want to see this movie. Unfortunately, this movie totally lacks magic, I found everything flat, a replica. This is the worst thing I've seen"
0,"Readable, but where are the maps?: The book was interesting to someone who enjoys reading history. A definite disappointment when no maps or any other illustration appeared although frequently cited."""
0,"Lots of art, little food and accommodation: I was very disappointed in the book - I was expecting a lot of helpful advice on finding a comfortable hotel and cheap meal, but there was almost no information on these topics. Instead, the author provides brilliant details about the few items he believes to be seen in the major museums in London. Well, thanks, my taste for art is different from its taste."
0,"Not as good as other travel books: I am surprised by the positive comments this book has received. It is severely lacking in maps, the maps it contains are unclear, and there is no coordination between the descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail you'll find in some other books. Overall, I was very disappointed with this book."
0,"This is a very fun game for teenagers and adults. I would not recommend to young children without strict parenting guidance. Here's why: This is a game to play some evil roles.

0,"Waste of money: This book is outdated and incorrect in many cases. The author provides data from the 1980s, and there is no real substance behind his recommendations. Frankly, I didn't get a single idea from this book. Do not waste your money! """
0,Poor quality: The sponge smells like some sort of chemical was used on it. The hand massage tool is indented. The bath salt smells just as bad as the sponge. I am honestly thinking about just throwing away a majority of this product and buying everything locally..
0,I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED TO FIND The PRODUCT HAD NO FRAGRANCE. IT ONLY HAS BODY WASH AND LOTION AND A BUNCH OF USELESS ITEMS. THERE IS NO BODY SPRAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE FOR THE PRICE.
0,IT WORRIES ME WHEN SELLERS DON'T PUT MEASUREMENTS: I don't trust sellers that don't add measurements and reliable information. They are always hiding something.

0,Too small!: Was looking to put these on my car and they are just too small. I should have read the size closer before ordering.
0,So Disappointing! Hurts your ears: I received it as a gift the next Xmas. The blender does an okay job blending and it has a glass jar. That is about it for the positives. It is the loudest kitchen appliance I have ever heard. My ears ring after using it and sometimes it hurts my ears. Do not purchase this blender! This is the first time I have been disappointed.
0,"I bought this blender. After a few months of use, it just stopped working. Still under warrantee, I mailed it to the company . 2 months later they mailed me a new blender. Two months after the warrantee expired it stopped working again. I am disappointed"
0,"If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudite and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience."
1,"Great product!: durable, handy, perfect size, plenty of pockets. I use it to hold tools, tow strap, and jumper cables and throw in the back of my pickup. It works great!"
1,"This is one of my favorite candies. It's very chewy, and it tastes sort of citrusy, but sweet. It has an inner wrapper of rice paper that you can eat, it kind of melts in your mouth. Each pack of this candy comes with a very cute sticker. Worth getting."
1,"I ordered this cookbook in February and have made 6 or 7 of the recipes .Everyone has been tasty and not hard to prepare. There are symbols at the top of each recipe that alert you to quick or hot ones. Index guides me to recipes containing the ingredients I have on hand. Recipes use avariety of spices and herbs, which make them quite satisfying. The roasted vegetables and the Rosemary Chicken are our favorites so far."
1,Leather phone case: Excellent product overall. Shipping was very fast! My only complaint is that the phone needs to be removed from the case to use the camera option ... the hole in the case for the camera eye covers part of the eye..
1,Good quality tools!: I give the Clean-Up Kit 4 stars. Every item functions as it should and are made of high quality plastic. The extension wands are steel and the the squeegees on the wet attatchment are nice and sturdy. The favorite attachment of mine is the big floor tool. This thing can be used through-out the entire house. It has a foot switch to raise and lower the brushes for carpet or bare floors. The reason I only went 4 stars is because the tools are good enough .
1,The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way reading the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
1,"Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! The singer voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting airy. Perfection!"
1,Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (high shcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.

1,"Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail.Children is fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start."
1,"Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception, but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would of gave it a 5 if I had not read the others."
1,"Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of ""playing with future"" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us."
1,"This book takes a typical family, examines its separate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has. I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together."
1,"So much better than the apple version!: I love it, it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot! It's wonderful!"
1,"Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!. Get this. You'll not regret it."
1,"Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended."
1,"A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like.. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered."
1,"Quite Satisfactory: This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. But once again, that’s a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase."
1,Classic: Watched this for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!
1,"This is a good product!: When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord breakdown. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!"
1,My daughter wanted this set of toys. We bought it and it was of high quality. Not disappointing at all. I would recommend anyone to this manufacturer.
1,"Excellent, real cleaning and best performance compared to its price: we are 100% satisfied with our decision to purchase a Bissell vacuum cleaner for its cleaning and suction performance. Easy to operate, relatively low noise, best price, and beautiful appearance."
1,"A very happy customer: a person with a heavy vacuum cleaner can make multiple presence at the same time. But a person who has a heavy vacuum cleaner will not sweep my apartment every day for an hour. Rumba vacuum cleaner will do this, and the result is that the floor is cleaner. I allow her every morning while I get ready to work and I have no problems with it .."
1,"best gummi peaches ever: i love candy, and i love haribo, these gummi peaches give me a sense of nostalgia and are easily my favorite...i highly recommend these..."
1,"Excellent product for the price: very durable and comfortable. Little air is lost on extended use, but adding air is very easy."
1,"One of my favorite movies: So glad I could find it in DVD. Perfect condition. Love the extras. What can you say about a perfect product, great seller, super fast seller, great price. All good. No that's wrong..........GREAT everything!!!!"
1,"I love this movie, it's a fun romantic family movie that you will enjoy."
1,"High quality product: I use this mattress for camping. For the price, it is irresistible. I weighed 215 pounds, and I didn't lose any air in the mattress for the first two days, a little bit on the third day. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this over its competitors."
1,"Perfect for what we need: We ordered two of these airbags. I gave it four stars because the second one had a leak, I prepared it (very easy operation) and received a replacement (without leaks!) Quickly. Easy to inflate and empty, I think this product is worth the money!"
1,"Great product. I installed the antenna everywhere possible in my Tahoe, and it worked regardless of where it was. Great, easy-to-use program that gives you real-time accident reports (depending on your location). I would recommend this hardware suite for anyone who wants GPS solutions for their car."
1,"Hope you own a battery shop: This is a really great radio, but it consumes batteries and has no charger. Stay away from this product."
1,Good value: the device is good but batteries tend to lose a lot of energy quickly. A small handy unit.
1,Great invention: It is a versatile (all-in-one) glass breaker and seat belt cutter in case the car breaks down. One got for me and one for my mom.
1,"Lack of service / support: this vacuum cleaner worked great for the first few weeks, good cleaning, very quiet and unobtrusive. Then the problems started. The company sent a replacement for free but that didn't solve the problem."
1,"For the price, it's great. The fact that the latch is not very reliable, especially with my 200lbs weight. Though it is good for my uses."
1,"Movie and excellent seller: I saw this movie when it first appeared, and it was beautiful. I am very happy to have it on DVD. Some may find it slow in some ways, but I loved it. . A great epic movie. The seller was very fast and made the purchase seem like I was buying from a friend."
1,I love this book: I read this book completely from start to finish in one day. It was great. Full of useful information.
1,It's awesome !: This is really a great CD. This band has many political and social ideas. You just have to understand it.

1,A text book worth keeping as a reference: this is a text book that I won't sell again! I love his classified pages. I am sure I will return to it during the rest of the college courses..
1,"Very nice for the price: The glider is easily assembled, looks great, and rocks smoothly. I would highly recommend this product to someone looking for a nice glider at an affordable price."""
1,love it!: very comfortable and easy to put together!! cant believe how fast it arrived after placing order!! no tools required!! would def. recommend this!
1,"Worth it!: Its so simple to assemble this thing. The feel that the wood is a bit light when you are assembling this thing but after it is assembled, it looks nice and sturdy...Worth the low price of $125 I bought it at..."""
1,"Great choice for the budget conscious: I think this is a great option for the budget conscious. It looks good, it's comfortable, and does the same Job that $1,000 chairs do. The only negatives are that sometimes mine squeaks so I'm gonna try some WD40 and hopefully that will help. Also, the seat cushion could be a little more plush."""
1,"I loved it: despite what many other reviewers have said, it is a great bench and easy to assemble. The flaws are barely noticeable; it blends perfectly with the furniture in the nursery and is great for putting a toddler in sleep. It is very comfortable"
1,"love it!: It was a great buy, we are very pleased with how easy it was to assemble and it just looks great!"""
1,"Great chair, great price: This chair was cheaper on Amazon than any other website. The chair was received very quickly. It is a really good looking chair. Although I haven't sat there for long periods of time yet, it looks very comfortable."
1,Great Buy: This will truly test your knowledge and skill. It will definitely push you to be better than before.
1,"Wonderful scents: This is the second bottle of Freesia scent, I just love this fragrance, it's light, delicate and beautiful"
1,"Great Chair: Easy assembly and a great price!Very comfortable, well made, nice fabric.Would recommend this chair as a must buy."""
1,DVD: It was an excellent movie. We have all of them. I would recommend this movie to others. It is an amazing movie.
1,"Excellent !!!: It's a very complete CD of all of  glory days . Enjoy, good,fine,classic  music."
1,"GREAT!: I must say, buying this cd was worth it! At first it doesn't seem like it's good, but as you listen more and more, you'll fall into her magical spell. There are only 2 chants in this Cd that I don't like, but the rest are good!"""
1,Nice chair at a reasonable price: This chair is very comfortable and durable
1,A good read: The characters were interesting and the story kept me hooked until the end. I would recommend it to fans of the adventure lovers.
1,Fun toy: Was purchased for our 5 year old grandson and he loved it. It was easy to work and could change your voice in a variety of ways.
1,"Excellent Communication Skills Tool !: I almost read this book from cover to cover, found it interesting, useful, easy to read and can be applied to my work. Very useful advice on how to deal with all kinds of situations. . Professionally written, applicable to all types of situations, great for all levels of experience."
1,A good movie from start to finish!: You will enjoy every minute of this movie (assuming you like  adventures movies). There are some terrific scenes in this one.
1,"Great: Easy to set up, easy to use. Very accurate with minimal time lags"
1,"Excellent little notebook. I find the small size is just large enough to carry around, but still have plenty of room to write in comfortably."
1,"Great product, as shown, this decorative tray looks great and works incredibly well. It feels perfectly crafted to last long"
1,"The film was shipped very quickly and was received on time. Upon opening the film case, he found that the film was somewhat scratched. The seemingly fine movie was shown, and I think these films need more protection while shipping, and I am glad that the movie has not been damaged."
1,thank you for this movie in dvd. my father and i used to watch this movie over and over again.  it's something that we shared in his lifetime and made us laugh. thank you again.
1,I have been taking this for a few weeks now with no side effects. Not sure how much or if it is actually helping but it's sure worth a try and its natural.
1,"This bag may be useful for school children. Probably not recommended for laptop. Inappropriately designed for office use. Narrow at the top so that if you want to carry the document, it will fold at the top. There is no section for a bottle of water. I wouldn't say it deserves 5 stars, but looking at  its price, it's worth buying"
1,"This book was very romantic, and I found the love story very believable.  I do recommend it to anyone who loves books that feature love at first sight and innocent love."
1,"I have a set of spoons a little deeper and all of their metal handles are a little thinner, I use them continuously and permanently, but this set is well made and well designed for the price."
1,"My grandson, just loves this DVD. He can sit and watch it over and over. This is a good buy for a toddler."
1,"The story is great and the music is calm and beautiful, I listen to music sometimes when going to sleep, and it feels great to relax and rest"
1,I enjoyed watching this dvd because it was based on facts and supported by personal interviews of the famlies. It taught me some things about our society that I had not heard before. I liked it.
1,Fast and easy shipping of this water filter: better price than any other website. Fast delivery. I can't say much about the water quality as I don't use cold water. It's mainly intended for an icemaker and I can't really tell the difference.
1,"Great price for a great filter, this filter was purchased online, and we arrived right away .. Just be sure to read the instructions on the filter before removing the old filter and replacing it with the new one."
1,"I found this product to be the best alternative to my fridge, it works like magic. It lasts for more than 6 months for a family of 3. The water in it has a wonderful and distinctive taste."
1,"The water filter is well priced compared to local store purchase. We ordered this filter online, it arrived quickly and was easy to install. It works great so far."
1,These filters work well and are much cheaper than large hardware stores. The water becomes clearer and tastes great when it cools.
1,"This plank is great . The plank is very sturdy, but not too heavy to use, and I've also used it to cook other foods. But it's best with fish, take my word for it. Don't let the so-so art on it throw you off, this cooking plank is excellent."""
1,This playhouse is adorable. My grandchildren ages 3 and 10 months have played for hours in it.The best part is that we can collapse it and store when not in use.
1,"This was a really hard book to put down. A wonderfully written book to make the reader think what they think is right and wrong. ."""
1,totally lovely: i love the brillant color and the weight is right..just what i wanted for my new home.. i am so pleased
1,"Unlike other s' experiences, the product I received was a genuine product that uses good filtration system. Replacing the filter in my refrigerator was simple and took less than a minute."""
1,"Very fantastic affordable headphones. They feel very durable and are extremely comfortable for long listening sessions. Probably the best headphones i've ever owned."""
1,"Very good product: I've been using this water filter for some years now. It fits, works and lasts as described. Very good time delivery and price."""
0,"The front of this product indicates that it can be used outside the house in the open air, and the back of the product is written on it that it is not suitable for use in places where it is directly exposed to water, but it is raining in the open air. I worked this product for about a week outside then it stopped working and I can't turn it on anymore. I do not recommend it."
0,"Gentle, but painful: This shoe is so cute but the fabric is so stiff and rough that it made it impossible for me to wear it for more than half an hour before taking it off. I don't like having to ""break"" a shoe. It is not only uncomfortable but also painful. Well, I guess I got what I paid for."
0,"Not waterproof: We got this watch for my daughter as a birthday gift. The watch did not last until 3 months. My daughter jumped into the pool and the clock was dead. Of course at this stage there is no exchange or refund. We bought her a second watch, a different color the same. It clearly states it is water resistant to 99 feet. My daughter has never come close to that. We are very disappointed in this kind of watch."
0,"I think the water on the watch face is a very good indication that this watch is not really ""water resistant"" to 99 feet. The bathtub is probably 16 inches deep and that is the only place our 5-year-old daughter used this in the two days she has had it. When your child thinks she has broken her birthday gift when, in fact, it was just a cheap watch. Not good."
0,"I used to love this product just as many do. Unfortunately, a small piece of the knife blade broke into the food I was cutting, and if I hadn't seen it, my kids could have swallowed the blade. . After you were well aware of the danger, the manufacturer's only response was to offer another blade of the same dangerous blade."
0,"Dangerous chair: Within months of owning this rocking chair, the back broke from where it came into contact with the seat! My mother-in-law was shaking my daughter to sleep - without warning or anything. Very disappointing considering the cost of the chair. I will contact the manufacturer to see if I can get a refund and buy a different chair."
0,"Disappointed: The handle is too small. The metal is very soft, so that scratches are very easy. very cheap. The quality is not high. I will never buy cookware of this brand again ..."
0,"This rocking chair is a gift for my sister. We were disappointed to learn that the cargo delivered was damaged and the chair leg was broken. The shipment also arrived without notice so it came while they were on vacation. We wondered why we had been asked to give their phone number if no one intended to contact them about the shipment. We were so embarrassed that we put my sister and her husband into so much overtime when it was supposed to be a nice gift. Once everything is fixed, they will be happy with the product."
0,"Dont buy it: If you are not a professional chef don't buy it. I only used it once and it became yellow. I decided to return it, since after one day of using it, it looked just like my 5 year old cookware."
0,"Stop! Don't buy this set of litter. This set of pots and pans is the largest litter I have ever bought. Within two weeks, all of the pots and pans in this set were either scattered, stained, or chipped. Be careful, buyer."
0,"This movie could have been awesome but it is far from it, and perhaps one of the worst movies this producing company has ever made. It is slow moving, not new events. Just a waste of time"
0,"My son is obsessed with Disney cartoons, so it was natural for him to want to see this movie. Unfortunately, this movie totally lacks magic, I found everything flat, a replica. This is the worst thing I've seen"
0,It stinks!: Months of airing out can not take away the hideous stench coming out of these mats. Avoid at all costs.
0,"Disappointed: This was my first Danielle Steel novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed by it. The plot was interesting enough that I stuck with it to the end, but the book was in serious need of a good editor. The author repeated herself repeatedly. I felt as though I were reading a first draft instead of a finished product. If you enjoy reading for the character development and beauty of the language as much as the plot, I do not recommend this book."
0,"I bought this blender. After a few months of use, it just stopped working. Still under warrantee, I mailed it to the company. 2 months later they mailed me a new blender. Two months after the warrantee expired it stopped working again. I am disappointed "
0,Not a blender for frozen fruit: Bought this blender a year ago to make smoothies using frozen fruit. I thought it worked great. Now the blades won't turn and the bottom rusting of all things.
0,"So Disappointing! Hurts your ears: I received it as a gift the next Xmas. The blender does an okay job blending and it has a glass jar. That is about it for the positives. It is the loudest kitchen appliance I have ever heard. My ears ring after using it and sometimes it hurts my ears. The rotation of the blades causes the blender jar to untwist from the base. Guess how much fun that is to clean up. So, not only is it so loud you want to be in another room when it is running, you must stand there and hold the jar still or you will have a true mess on your hands. Do not purchase this blender! This is the first time I have been disappointed. "
0,"Lasted a few minutes!: I wanted to buy the Thermoworks (new and improved) thermometer, but amazon offered it through an outside vendor which charged a shipping fee... and this one seemed to have gotten okay reviews, so i went with the cheaper option. i received it this past week and used it last night on our steaks. it started off okay. i was able to set the correct temperature on the display and saw that the temperature reading was going down once the probe went from the counter to the meat. when i looked over about 5 minutes later, the display was blank. i tried the power button but to no avail. i then thought it may be the battery, but even with a fresh one, the power wouldn't turn back on!so unless you need a disposable thermometer that lasts only for a few minutes, move onto another brand!"
0,junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. . Skip it.
0,Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
0,"Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then: I think this product provided a great. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. This product is far too"
0,"Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time."
0,"Predictable & has a lame ending: I have read all of this author  novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) . I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable."
0,"a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husband and me put it together easily but the scotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it."
0,"Not Very good: I dont advise buying this grider, it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper."
0,"Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord: This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers aroundso don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""plug"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a better."
0,"Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. this author  is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"
0,Horrible reader: i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
0,"Unreadable!: As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
0,"very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all."
0,"Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. . There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.. I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time."
0,The worst book in the world !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was my worst book I have ever read it in my whole life! I had to read it for school. It was very complicated and boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone !! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book !! Read something else !!
0,"DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality."
0,"Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this."
0,"DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
0,"Not!: If you want to listen this singer  , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated."
0,"Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done."
0,"Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again."
0,"Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund."
0,Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially.
0,nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a comment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
0,Broken :(: Base and frame not fully attached. Fixed with a little bit of glue. My friend didn't like it after that.
0,"Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time."

0,where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
0,"waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This product fell apart at second use, with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard, horribly designed and made product!!!!!"
0,ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
0,"Boring and Sloppy: Well, I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need for this product. It's been covered in mud ... what's wrong with that? It's boring"
0,"A book for those with time on their hands: If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience"
0,"Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"

0,"Trash: complete trash, sound quality is poor, if you are going to produce the best CD then record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a damp cloth."
0,I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
0,"same problems of previous  version: Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- till  unscrewing . Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice ."
0,Unreadable!: the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate.
0,"Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment."
0,Two Tedious Hours: The early success this guy  films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - I enjoyed some of th films
0,one of the worst movies of 2002: god!!! what a dumb movie.
0,"very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical  movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all."
0,"Not the worst, but far from good: This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book ""The 50 worst films of all time"". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either."
0,"Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?: I have, too, but this isn't it. The translation is very choppy"
0,Awful: This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It lasts long with a lot of padding that looks out of place.
0,Low class effort by this  Band: the music is bland and. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.
0,"After a few months- broken: This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality."
0,Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
0,A Cruel and Frustrating Story: The author paints a harsh picture of women in lower society. Either you will be tempted or cause evil. He created a virtuous woman and terminated her as a criminal. It is impossible for a virtuous woman to turn into a criminal. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone seeking an escape from depression.
0,"Bad purchace.: Well I thought I was getting the student edition, but I got the Instructor's edition."
0,"Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned."
0,I hated this book then and I hate it now. My only revenge for compelling me to read this book as a child is writing a negative review as an adult.
0,"disappointed: I have been very impressed by the  music . However, the  music did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style, it was a great disappointment, and this is one CD I will get rid of quickly."
0,I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!
0,"I expected more: This dover little activity book isn't as lovely as it could be. Extremely plain designs, and the only planets shown are Saturn and Earth. Half the pictures are of stars, and they're boring, plain. I could draw this just as good as they do, and I am no kind of an artist."
0,"not worth the money: This book was useless, I returned it immediately. The author relies on beautiful photos to make it look like something special. .. I found it to be so basic that it bordered on laughable."
0,"Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing."
0,I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
0,"As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work."
0,Not so entertaining: Purchased for may nephew who noted that the pieces are very small and pretty low quality.
0,"TOO SMALL! I wish it were bigger and more durable....: I recieved this for Christmas and have only played with it once because it got boring.The furniture takes up WAY too much room.  The little coffee table that comes with it is sopposed to store CD's, but it falls apart."
0,"I was not happy . The last time I ordered this product I received a bottle  the size for 2x the price of what I paid . Inaddition, the sprayer doesn't work"
0,"a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
0,a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE.

0,Poor Production Quality : The Production quality of this dvd is that of a home movie. Sound is patchy. The camera operator tried to go for some of those artsy shots  but I only lasted 15 minutes before the poor quality became unbearable.
0,Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help . The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
0,"Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind the author  and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time"
0,"While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading."
0,"Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Now that singer  is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past."
0,Poor Quality: Item arrived appearing to be the quality expected for the paid price. It wasn't used enough to get it dirty . It was apparant from checking it that it was defective workmanship.
0,Quality has changed drastically for the worse: I have been buying these bags for my vacuum for over three years and up until now they have worked satisfactorily. This last batch however has been a disaster. Dirt is spewed all over the interior of the vacuum and I was having to replace bags sometimes three times a week. The situation was so bad .. I would highly suggest not buying these bags.
0,Don't work: These bags do not fit properly and don't make a seal.To make them work at all you have to push the rubber seal onto the plastic fitting.Not worth it and could potentially damage your vacuum...
0,don't overload it: I have had the unit for about 2+ years. It is a very good 'blower'. For the first time in the 2 years I've owned it I decided to vacuum some leaves. Within seconds the motor began to burn up. I noticed one of the blades had broken too. With the broken blade it caused it to be unbalanced and consequently did not function well.
0,YELLOW??? ADVERTISED BLACK: The picture is black. Nowhere in the description does it mention that it's bright yellow. I would've payed more for a black one and I'm very disappointed about this false advertising!
0,"disappointing: I have read some of the other ""negative"" reviews and have found them to be frustrating.  That doesn't seem to be a fair rating of the book itself as a book. I am personally okay with the premise - I guess we will all find out whose interpretation is correct when the time comes. I just plain found this book to be a disappointment. The plot was extremely thin, and I was truly disappointed to have the series end this way - maybe they should have covered the real plot points of this book in the previous one and let it end there."
0,"Poor quality: There are some breath-taking views in this book. However, most of the photos are ruined by absolutely horrible color processing and production. I'm assuming most of the washed out, brownish tints come from a shoddy production process, but who knows. I was very, very disappointed that most every picture was ruined by such poor color reproduction."
0,"boring: I took the kids with babysit, ages 9, 6, and 4. I thought that they would like it but all 3 of them were totally bored. We didn't even finish the movie. 30 mins into the movie they were beging for us to leave and I was  upset . I did not get to finish it."
0,Worst Jeans I've Ever Bought: I have been buying trouser 40 years and can't believe the jeans I just purchased.They have gone down in quality and up in price. They seem a cheap pair of designerjeans. The weight of the material is lighter and they have reduced the number of belt loops.I hate them..
0,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read, and was incredibly disappointing . The entire story was confusing and hard to follow, and the ""ending"" did not tie up well at all. I would suggest skipping this one."
0,Didn't Work: Nothing worked on it when I took it out of the box. It seemed cheap made. I sent it back.
0,"Weak heater, Arrived broken: This heater is not very efficient. It doesn't seem to put out more heat than your average hairdryer. For something this big you would think it would be able to create more heat.This thing arrived broken. the shipping was so bad . it broke."
0,"Poor quality at best.: The belt is attached to the buckle by two tiny screws. One of them fell off a month after the belt was bought, rendering the whole thing almost useless. A little later the paint on the buckle started to chip away, exposing the true color (brass) of the buckle, giving an uncomplimentary look. Definitely would not recommend it."
0,"Disappointing: The search for a good corded phone has become difficult in this wireless world. I tried this Panasonic phone, which seemed adequate, but am now finding that I need to replace it after 15 months of use. The Caller ID display was always annoying , it failed completely."
0,"Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back will not hold anything heavier than a very  small  light  . I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for."
0,"What a disappointment!: I am a big this author  fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all . Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money this  story  in the future."
0,"You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now."
0,junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
0,Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
0,"A waste of valuable reading time: All I can say is that if I read this first, I wouldn't be reading another story. The helicopter jump. I almost stopped reading it, but I finished."
0,"Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time."
0,"The front of this product indicates that it can be used outside the house in the open air, and the back of the product is written on it that it is not suitable for use in places where it is directly exposed to water, but it is raining in the open air. I worked this product for about a week outside then it stopped working and I can't turn it on anymore. I do not recommend it."
0,"Gentle, but painful: This shoe is so cute but the fabric is so stiff and rough that it made it impossible for me to wear it for more than half an hour before taking it off. I don't like having to ""break"" a shoe. It is not only uncomfortable but also painful. Well, I guess I got what I paid for."
0,"Not waterproof: We got this watch for my daughter as a birthday gift. The watch did not last until 3 months. My daughter jumped into the pool and the clock was dead. Of course at this stage there is no exchange or refund. We bought her a second watch, a different color the same. It clearly states it is water resistant to 99 feet. My daughter has never come close to that. We are very disappointed in this kind of watch."
0,"I think the water on the watch face is a very good indication that this watch is not really ""water resistant"" to 99 feet. The bathtub is probably 16 inches deep and that is the only place our 5-year-old daughter used this in the two days she has had it. When your child thinks she has broken her birthday gift when, in fact, it was just a cheap watch. Not good."
0,"I used to love this product just as many do. Unfortunately, a small piece of the knife blade broke into the food I was cutting, and if I hadn't seen it, my kids could have swallowed the blade. . After you were well aware of the danger, the manufacturer's only response was to offer another blade of the same dangerous blade."
0,"Dangerous chair: Within months of owning this rocking chair, the back broke from where it came into contact with the seat! My mother-in-law was shaking my daughter to sleep - without warning or anything. Very disappointing considering the cost of the chair. I will contact the manufacturer to see if I can get a refund and buy a different chair."
0,"Disappointed: The handle is too small. The metal is very soft, so that scratches are very easy. very cheap. The quality is not high. I will never buy cookware of this brand again ..."
0,"This rocking chair is a gift for my sister. We were disappointed to learn that the cargo delivered was damaged and the chair leg was broken. The shipment also arrived without notice so it came while they were on vacation. We wondered why we had been asked to give their phone number if no one intended to contact them about the shipment. We were so embarrassed that we put my sister and her husband into so much overtime when it was supposed to be a nice gift. Once everything is fixed, they will be happy with the product."
0,"Dont buy it: If you are not a professional chef don't buy it. I only used it once and it became yellow. I decided to return it, since after one day of using it, it looked just like my 5 year old cookware."
0,"Stop! Don't buy this set of litter. This set of pots and pans is the largest litter I have ever bought. Within two weeks, all of the pots and pans in this set were either scattered, stained, or chipped. Be careful, buyer."
1,excellent: these are all I was looking for in a set of cookware.easy clean up even when something sticks .give best performance.I would recommend these pans to anyone who enjoys cooking.
1,Love shiney pans: The ten piece set of Cuisinart pans arrived with shine and bright. Love that look...they work very well...a little stick here and there but the shine is gone...darn. Do I need to scrub a little harder...they are worth it. The weight of the pans seems to be just right...not too heavy but not light.
1,"Not happy with this purchase: I read most of the comments about this set and I see that the vast majority have nothing but cool things to say about it. However, I am not one of those lucky ones. I just bought this set and received it less than a week ago. I put the stove on medium heat and smoked the pan like crazy until it had a copper color that I can't remove. I cleaned and cleaned like crazy and managed to remove a layer of it, but the rest is from the pan itself. I am very disappointed that I purchased this set and wish I had read the negative comments a little more carefully before I spent my money on something that I thought was getting a good deal. Don't buy this set or you will be very disappointed!"
1,I have used this set of cookware since seven years . My husband and I are cooks and we have used them quite regularly. I have had no problems with the pans whatsoever. I can't recommend these enough.
1,"Good soap, but it smells bad, this is a good soap, but I wished that when I use it, it leaves a fresh scent on my skin."
1,"This kind of soap is hard to find, I love the great glycerine soap. It's getting harder to find. Glycerin soap cleans well and moisturizes without leaving a thin film on your skin."
1,Leather protector protects from scratches and drops. Really very good I will recommend it anytime.
1,"great pots and pans: These stainless steel pots and pans are great! It is good value for the money. I bought these for my college going son. I did not want to spend as much , but still wanted something that would last a while. He loves them. One thing he did mention is that the pot he uses for pasta got rainbow colored spots. I think that perhaps he used very high heat setting. I think that medium heat is all you need to use with this set. Overall, for look, price and performance, I would highly recommend this set."
1,"A great start with this high-quality cookware set: good quality. This was a substitute for another set of stainless steel. You'll get years, years, and years of use from this set."
1,"My first real cookware set: I bought this one based on other reviews, and I'm happy with my purchase. I feel more inspired and really look forward to cooking. This is a great alternative to more expensive brands, it heats up well, looks shiny and comes at a great price."
1,DvD was transferred without incident. It proved to be playable on an existing DvD player and was very enjoyable to view.
1,"Awesome machine! Good customer service This coffee maker looks great! And it works great! I have used the espresso and coffee machine and am happy with both. I am not a connoisseur of coffee but I only prepare gourmet coffee from here and it works great. !!! I have received the machine and it was not working properly. Customer service was called in, and it turned out to be a defective part that was sent along with the unit. They immediately sent me a spare part."
1,"Good reliable product.: This product is very good and reliable. If batery is in good condition, the charging period is relatively short. When bateries are not in optimum condition, you will notice that charging time increase, so you should program for an on time replacement."
1,"The price is nice ""BUT"": I bought this coffee maker for the speed it claimed and the price.I will not make that mistake again.About every 30 minutes the element comes on to heat the water inside up and it gets louder every day,sounds like a jet engine after about a month.I will be reading reviews before purchasing another brand."
1,"A breathtaking book!!: A gripping read! Once I started reading this page-turner, I couldn't put it down! Fascinating detail of one of the major events in history, and stunningly written.The best book I have read in ages."

1,"A stylish addition to any kitchen, this heavy and bulky thing to make bread full of flair and love, should last for many years."
1,I think this book was awesome! I am always happy to find a good novel that is unpredictable and unusual and intrigues me. Give the book the time it deserves to focus on the subtleties and nuances.
1,best baking!: i bake cookies that everyone love each year for the holidays.. every cookie is perfect with my air bake cookie sheet!
1,"the best book I've read in long time. I rarely find a book that can keep my interest,  this book I couldn't put down, I even took it with me in my car and read while sitting at red lights. I highly recommend this book"
1,"Travel Chair. I bought two of these. One for me (I have back issues) and one for my mother (who can't go long distances due to back issues). With them we were able to attend a 2 hour walking garden tour. Since there is so much standing, we simply took out of chairs (lightweight and easy to sling over your shoulder) and took a rest as needed. Brilliant idea - great gift idea for that person who can't walk long distances ."
1,"handy for waiting for bus: I take this with me when taking the bus. I'm disabled and can't stand too long, many places have no benches, this chair comes in handy, I put it over my shoulder[ the shoulder strap is really handy] and carry it with me on the bus, it really comes in handy."""
1,Excellent camping chair. Bought it for my son to take on camping trips with his boy scout group. He loves it. Its light weight to carry and sturdy.
1,"I ADORE this chair. Easy to carry over my shoulder . easily transport and use instead of standing for a long time. I take it with me on group  trips. so I have something to sit on if we are remaining in place for awhile. Sure spares me from getting backaches while standing too long!"""
1,No problem if I'm in a furniture store but a major problem if I'm on tour or at a location with no chairs/benches .I sling this little stool over my shoulder & to most people it appears to be a camera tripod.Popping it open when I need to sit is simple and instant.
1,"Handy yes,  - I bought this chair .  it's not very comfortable, but it is better than sitting on the ground or standing for prolonged periods, as long as you're on solid ground."
1,"I bought this chair for two main purposes, one is to carry and use to sit on if needed, the right size for me. The second purpose is to use it under the table at conferences where I cannot sit for long periods of time with my feet. It is working well."
1,"Easily one of the best chairs  . Light, sturdy, and looks cool. Everything you could expect from 3 pieces of aluminum tied together ."
1,"I'm a big guy and this stool holds my weight and is comfortable. I purchased this stool for a 20 mile  trip, it is lightweight and compact."""
1,"Tripod and seat size, makes this travel chair excruciatingly uncomfortable for anyone weighing more than 120 lbs. On the other hand, since the chair looks rather sturdy, it should be completely acceptable to women and young children. ”"
1,My wife loves it: Fantastic product. My wife loved it. Expensive for such cooking pot  but worth every fils.
1,"nice  Cooking bowl  It cooks at the right temperature for the right amount of time and the food comes out great. The glass lid  keeps the moisture in. It also has large stay cool handles. Highly recommend this bowl Believe me, this is the best!!"

1,Works very well: Love this heater great at keeping my room warm comfortably. the thermostat works amazingly well. it keeps the room warm all over .

1,Heater: Have had the product for about 2 weeks now and so far so good. Have a large family room in the basement where this heater is located and it does heat up the room
1,"One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs"

1,"Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go."
1,TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actually came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not believe the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
1,: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play.! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.

1,"works great: i bought this item to connect to a strong light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the ranges claimed, but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this .  I can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage.  now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know."
1,"This is the all time best book. She mentions in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soul mate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world."
1,This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart.

1,Wonderful: I went online for information about some  pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
1,.: This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.

1,The amazing pictures: I love love love these pictures !!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference .it definitely improves your posture
1,Good matt nude lipstick: It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
1,I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake..
1,"Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, it is a fantastic movie."
1,"I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition, rather than very good. I would like to thank the person who made it possible, but have misplaced her name and address."

1,"Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception, but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would  gave it a 5 if I had not read the others."
1,"Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail.Children is fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start."
1,"Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!"
1,The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
1,"To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game."
1,"this will interest children in insects: This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout, with many beautiful photographs (if insects can be called beautiful). The text, mixed nicely with the pictures, covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts."
1,"Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome, so has a good seal to it."
1,Almost perfect: Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them . The next order I will order one size larger. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more.

1,Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. 
1,"When the box arrived, I read the book alone because I couldn't stand to wait. uses a nice collection of short and medium-length words for beginning readers, and the story rollicks along. Mr. Howard's illustrations contain beautifully shaped expressions. We checked these books out of the library so often that we finally ordered some to keep."
1,"Water Filter: We ordered this water filter online, its price is very reasonable. Arrived quickly. We installed it right away and now the cold water tastes great again!"
1,"We bought two of these chairs for the kids. Chair height is good - it is longer than most similar chairs, lightweight and easy to carry. However, the plastic edges of his legs fell off. The chair was still usable."
