â€¢	One of the sentiment analysis process requirements is a dataset. In some cases there is insifficient dataset, which necessitates creating new one. Creating a dataset is not an easy task. It needs time, collaborative efforts, money, and other resources. The dataset which is presented here will save all mentioned factors: time, money, and efforts, not only for NLP community researcher but for all stakeholders. It can be used as a benchmark dataset for future NLP studies.
